00:00.570 --> 00:04.650
In this video you will learn how to create a profile API.

00:04.660 --> 00:08.090
Let's go ahead and do that technically for this specific route.

00:08.170 --> 00:11.720
It will have to be methods attached to it.

00:11.760 --> 00:14.920
One is get in and out of one is postmaster.

00:15.280 --> 00:20.320
Logically speaking the way to create both HTP methods are so good.

00:20.330 --> 00:21.950
A candid Yes.

00:22.110 --> 00:24.280
And I do rather

00:26.950 --> 00:34.180
fall rudder posts.

00:35.520 --> 00:38.680
There's another way to be more efficient.

00:38.680 --> 00:42.070
So you want to do rather.

00:42.610 --> 00:54.380
And one should file and then we have Geoff and most so technically this is how it is.

00:54.460 --> 00:56.110
Just like chaining method.

00:56.170 --> 00:56.700
All right.

00:56.830 --> 01:00.480
So you do want to save my colon here all you will see.

01:00.770 --> 01:02.670
So we're just going to do it like this.

01:02.710 --> 01:08.500
So it looks a bit nicer and you know under just one profile name center like this one.

01:08.740 --> 01:09.730
So we don't remove this

01:12.650 --> 01:16.030
and now we want to import our custom middleware.

01:16.030 --> 01:17.920
So it was good topic here.

01:18.410 --> 01:31.980
And Hans Jack jailable is giving me then wire me to where check NJDOT.

01:33.050 --> 01:34.270
Awesome.

01:35.150 --> 01:41.100
So here you are at Schacht is here.

01:42.160 --> 01:46.290
And Daniel so smart and next

01:48.800 --> 01:51.780
he wanted to do one

01:59.850 --> 02:00.630
or

02:05.370 --> 02:25.330
two.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.650
No don't put a semicolon here.

02:27.710 --> 02:28.940
It was in error.

02:29.440 --> 02:35.340
So the first thing we did is we put middleware first which is Jack Jadavpur T.

02:35.410 --> 02:40.660
It will run this Midwest first before proceeding with the function no matter what.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.760
Technically it will run this function first.

02:42.790 --> 02:45.450
It will check whether you provided the token or not.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.320
If it's not then it will return.

02:47.340 --> 02:54.860
You know no token it then it will find a single document which actually is the ID.

02:54.940 --> 03:00.320
So we passed that requires that the code that user got going to token is provided.

03:00.360 --> 03:08.690
Then this will have a value and then we simply you know response with three objects.

03:08.750 --> 03:13.780
Success user which is the most important and the message.

03:14.200 --> 03:21.010
So let's go ahead to our next one here and then let's go to our postman and let's test it out.

03:21.040 --> 03:26.650
So we got the talking first.

03:32.870 --> 03:36.510
Let's go out and test it first.

03:38.340 --> 03:43.180
You can not get a response obviously because you haven't seen it yet.

03:43.260 --> 03:43.880
So first

03:47.790 --> 03:50.340
all right let's go to the postman.

03:50.580 --> 03:52.220
It is a get method.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.070
So to could just you do get it.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.200
But we haven't you know send any token yet.

03:58.230 --> 04:02.030
So we want to check whether it returns this area or not.

04:02.040 --> 04:06.050
No token provide souls go to school and send.

04:06.050 --> 04:07.410
All right it's an error.

04:07.800 --> 04:15.300
Get a cost profile Let's go to use to you and serve as API.

04:15.420 --> 04:23.910
Once again we always forgot we got to save this file first and save this file and then check out termino

04:24.780 --> 04:25.720
magic happens.

04:25.720 --> 04:26.230
All right.

04:26.250 --> 04:30.880
So we go back here and then send no token can provide.

04:30.890 --> 04:34.790
So now let's you know enter some token Zeeshan

04:37.990 --> 04:41.100
and then you want to go to loggin.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.700
So you want to log in again.

04:42.750 --> 04:59.610
So this and try to correct one com pre so you get a token copy the entire thing copy here.

04:59.730 --> 05:00.580
Good header.

05:00.740 --> 05:11.520
Well you see here then you would send Filton Ted's token you know what because I copied all so.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.490
Meaning it's a wrong token.

05:13.530 --> 05:14.600
So it's correct.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.580
That is not the right token to send it again.

05:19.050 --> 05:22.790
Boom received the correct use object.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.030
Awesome.

05:24.120 --> 05:32.170
In the next video we will learn how to keep our users information so we can actually do it here.

05:32.180 --> 05:33.880
I'll see you guys in the next video.
