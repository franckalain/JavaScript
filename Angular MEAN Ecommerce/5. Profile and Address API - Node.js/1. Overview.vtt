00:00.630 --> 00:03.250
Hello guys will come back in a previous section.

00:03.300 --> 00:10.930
Adam Pearson has walked us through on how to build in features using Anglia mail and see.

00:11.250 --> 00:16.290
In this section we will learn how to create user profile and address API.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.200
Why do we need these two.

00:18.390 --> 00:20.590
Because we don't use information.

00:20.790 --> 00:26.520
It would be almost impossible to know who they are and where they're from and would be hard for sellers

00:26.520 --> 00:28.220
to ship the product.

00:28.290 --> 00:33.870
We need to create this crucial API before we proceed for a profile.

00:34.110 --> 00:41.790
We want to see use information like name and picture address is for the sellers to ship.

00:41.840 --> 00:50.590
We will learn specifically how to combine get and post under one route name in the next video.

00:50.760 --> 00:54.160
We will learn how to create our custom middleware.

00:54.430 --> 00:55.900
I'll see us in next few.
