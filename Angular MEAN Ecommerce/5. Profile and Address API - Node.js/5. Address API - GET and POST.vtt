00:00.670 --> 00:07.500
Hello guys will come back I want you guys to pause to view and try to create your own address.

00:07.510 --> 00:13.140
I see what it is the same as the one that would create in a big hand.

00:13.180 --> 00:16.480
It is exactly the same as profil API.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.320
I'm going to read for a bit.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.940
Actually I'm waiting for you guys actually.

00:23.830 --> 00:24.700
I'm still waiting.

00:25.770 --> 00:27.330
Time's up.

00:27.330 --> 00:29.640
I'm going to create another API.

00:30.060 --> 00:37.100
I'm going to copy and paste Profar API and change some of the code to fit the address API.

00:37.230 --> 00:41.180
So I was going to same capitis inditing if you want to learn.

00:41.180 --> 00:48.920
You should typing by myself typing up every single line here and change this to dress.

00:49.890 --> 00:58.620
And this one will be dress hoops and this one will be user dress.

00:58.910 --> 00:59.610
Awesome.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.700
And here you want to remove everything except you want to do it.

01:09.880 --> 01:13.860
Got that crest what it comes to

02:23.780 --> 02:24.890
it is pretty straightforward.

02:25.030 --> 02:29.440
Pessin the Gita will teach me to work to check what a token does exist or not.

02:29.660 --> 02:37.160
So that we can use request encoded user dot on a score ID then we're passing the address of the user

02:37.160 --> 02:43.690
as part of the Jason body user guide dress instead of just user put the post method.

02:43.780 --> 02:48.980
We simply check each of the requested body to see whether they are empty or not.

02:49.030 --> 02:56.980
If it is not empty then set it to the new value which is required by the address one to seek the state

02:56.980 --> 02:59.610
country or portico.

02:59.610 --> 03:04.630
Finally we save it and response back the message injection format.

03:04.930 --> 03:08.340
So that could change these two addresses.

03:09.130 --> 03:10.910
Let us test it on postman.

03:11.130 --> 03:19.020
The postman and capitis is here to address.

03:19.090 --> 03:23.160
So let's check on our show and we got to start the server

03:26.780 --> 03:30.980
connected to babies are like let's go in and click send.

03:31.460 --> 03:40.830
No two can provide it again we got to prove why it seem like this a transition or head or and as well

03:41.070 --> 03:52.890
as copy this entire thing was here and Dan sent it again true address is empty because you know we did

03:52.890 --> 03:58.050
not submit any data to address object just yet.

03:58.320 --> 04:02.690
So it was go ahead to close body and address.

04:02.730 --> 04:05.870
One will be changed to this one.

04:06.100 --> 04:11.140
This one will be awesome.

04:11.930 --> 04:13.730
I know I to call with any

04:16.590 --> 04:23.380
boss to see it.

04:25.560 --> 04:44.470
Also he wrote state I know the name is proving generic and postal code 9 0 2 1 0 1 and I think is about

04:44.530 --> 04:44.860
right.

04:44.860 --> 04:46.570
Let's check again.

04:46.930 --> 04:51.840
Country Let's go back to my country.

05:00.540 --> 05:05.970
Just watch our costs and this is amazing TV.

05:05.990 --> 05:07.220
So here's why.

05:07.320 --> 05:11.720
So now let's post it successfully added to your address.

05:11.720 --> 05:15.340
And there's good change used to get and sent one more time.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.880
And there you have it.

05:17.250 --> 05:25.230
Amazing in this video we learn how to address API for both post and get in the next section.

05:25.230 --> 05:28.320
Adam Petersen will handle the front end part.

05:28.350 --> 05:30.430
I'll see you guys in the next section.
