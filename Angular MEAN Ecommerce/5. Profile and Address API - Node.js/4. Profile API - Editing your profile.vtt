Hello gosh in this video we will learn how to use this information let us fill the post method which

00:07.590 --> 00:08.450
is here.

00:08.610 --> 00:12.000
So we want to do is you want to check your booty again.

00:12.360 --> 00:12.960
And then

00:16.020 --> 00:17.430
on the next

00:22.650 --> 00:22.970
one

00:27.130 --> 00:29.070
it

01:51.660 --> 01:52.830
is pretty straightforward.

01:52.880 --> 01:58.910
We're passing jailable teams to work to check what the token does exist or not so that we can use requests

01:59.350 --> 02:06.390
data coded that we check all the fields like name email and password to see whether they are empty or

02:06.390 --> 02:06.860
not.

02:07.140 --> 02:11.070
If not empty they will want to sell it to the new value.

02:11.070 --> 02:16.270
Finally we want to save the object and then response.

02:16.300 --> 02:26.010

02:48.890 --> 02:49.800
The real reason why.

02:49.820 --> 02:53.260
