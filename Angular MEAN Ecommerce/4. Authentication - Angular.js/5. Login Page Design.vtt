Hello they're in the last review.

00:03.230 --> 00:10.950
They've set up the logic for our lot in component in this we will be designing the layout or in pitch.

00:10.950 --> 00:16.700
Now let's open up our text editor and open in component.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.210
TMF

00:31.820 --> 00:39.560
here with next our message inside a container which is position in the center of the screen.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.830
This container would be only resetter only if we use the screen.

00:42.950 --> 00:44.200
It's larger than large

00:54.630 --> 00:55.370
here.

00:55.470 --> 00:57.940
We've created the cart below the message.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.690
If the heading teks not inside

01:34.490 --> 01:41.230
here we've created the lot inform this long form is pretty much similar to the registration form that

01:41.240 --> 01:43.360
we did a few weeks ago.

01:43.860 --> 01:51.080
And we do have set up the design lay out for our line pitch in the next video we're setting up the authentication

01:51.080 --> 01:53.010
grps for angular app.
