Hello they're in unless we deal with completely the logic needed for our registration page.

00:07.690 --> 00:11.600
In this we will be focusing on the design layout.

00:11.620 --> 00:19.850
Let's start by opening up our text editor and then opening up registration the component Ashia M.

00:35.670 --> 00:43.750
here the position our message inside a container and its position in the center of the screen.

00:43.760 --> 00:48.570
The container we only be Center only if they use a screen is larger than large

01:02.190 --> 01:02.770
here.

01:02.970 --> 01:09.060
They've created a cart load message with the hitting text registration

02:15.690 --> 02:16.420
here.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.840
We've created a form from inputs.

02:19.920 --> 02:26.200
I divide it into form groups and issue of them have their very own labels.

02:26.210 --> 02:32.100
The data of this inputs are bound to both state and humano.

02:32.580 --> 02:41.270
For example the name input here is bound to the name variable in setting the registration component.

02:41.280 --> 02:45.640
This will set up a design layout of a registration page.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.780
The next video will set up our lot in page.
