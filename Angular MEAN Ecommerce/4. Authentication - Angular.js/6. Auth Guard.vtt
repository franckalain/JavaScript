00:00.670 --> 00:07.140
You guys in the class we deal with completely the design lay out of our lot in pitch in this video.

00:07.530 --> 00:10.720
We'll be creating the authentication service.

00:10.720 --> 00:24.800
Let's open up our power shall we know stop the app and type in and generate the service of God.

00:27.490 --> 00:33.580
Once this is done type in research and let's minimize Arendal.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.030
Now that's open.

00:35.040 --> 00:35.860
Are you

00:50.890 --> 00:51.510
here.

00:51.590 --> 00:56.340
It's important our service and declare it as a provider.

00:56.850 --> 00:59.390
Now that's open letter of service

01:30.640 --> 01:31.380
here.

01:31.610 --> 01:39.370
Imported can activate activate it route snapshot rowdiest snapshot and router from the Engeland router

01:39.370 --> 01:44.290
package here we have declared dead of service.

01:44.650 --> 01:52.730
Humans can do it which means that the Cirus will have the can activate method inside a constructor of

01:52.780 --> 01:58.610
instantiated and get the router to connect you it or hear checks.

01:58.610 --> 02:05.660
If the use is currently locked in if the user is locked in the angular router redirect the user to the

02:05.660 --> 02:06.950
homepage.

02:07.280 --> 02:15.040
Otherwise to of got access to the route specified now that our service has been set up this time of

02:15.050 --> 02:17.070
use is better at routing would you.

02:17.390 --> 02:18.370
So let's open it up

02:31.740 --> 02:41.800
here if imported a got service and declare it inside it can do it probably inside it to route nodded

02:41.810 --> 02:46.990
off groceries series has been set up with the router the router redirect the user to the homescreen

02:47.530 --> 02:55.000
when the user ex-sister in their destruction page while he or she is locked in in this video set up

02:55.020 --> 03:02.200
a service which can let us get access to certain routes and then next week you will see a demonstration

03:02.560 --> 03:04.260
of what we have learned in this section.
