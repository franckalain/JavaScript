Hey guys in this we do we we're taking a look at what we've learned in this section.

00:05.550 --> 00:12.080
Let's start by opening up more power shall we know in the server directory piped in.

00:12.380 --> 00:24.480
So yes and then open up and search inside and result directory in the master window.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.470
Now let's go to a browser.

00:27.030 --> 00:30.540
Open up our app.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.600
Now let's go to the registration page

00:45.860 --> 00:48.780
and here we can see that registration is successful.

00:49.080 --> 00:55.120
If you go to our server command you can see the post request semi-successful.

00:55.120 --> 01:01.200
Now let's open up our guest so called application stretch.

01:01.250 --> 01:04.660
We can see our token start here.

01:04.670 --> 01:09.120
Now let's look up and we can see that a token is clear.

01:09.110 --> 01:24.410
Now let's look in again.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.910
Now we are locked in here.

01:26.910 --> 01:29.730
We can see that a token inside a local store.

01:29.730 --> 01:36.610
Again in this video we've seen a demonstration off our locked in a registry function.

01:36.810 --> 01:40.980
The next session we're setting up our profile and address API on the server site.
