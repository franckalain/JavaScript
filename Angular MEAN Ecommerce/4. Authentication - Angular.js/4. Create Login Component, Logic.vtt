00:00.360 --> 00:08.130
High there in the last video if set up the design of a registration page in this radio you'll create

00:08.360 --> 00:11.790
in pitch and set the logic required.

00:11.790 --> 00:13.920
Now let's open up our show

00:18.420 --> 00:23.960
and type in and generate Koppelman Lufkin

00:39.680 --> 00:41.120
once this is done.

00:41.490 --> 00:43.130
And Sir.

00:44.440 --> 00:47.170
And then you minimize the window.

00:47.170 --> 00:52.950
Now let's open up text and editor and open at routeing would you.

01:05.120 --> 01:10.510
Here is important in component and declare it as a route.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.400
Now let's open up lock in component

01:38.790 --> 01:47.880
here imported the router data service and rest service and instantiate them inside the constructor.

01:48.450 --> 01:56.160
We've also declared the verbose email password will be useful a lot from later in the workbook but I'm

01:56.160 --> 01:57.060
disabled.

01:57.360 --> 02:00.290
We should be used for a in button later on

02:14.380 --> 02:15.220
here.

02:15.320 --> 02:22.180
Our validation method is created when you met the incident which is pretty much identical to that in

02:22.280 --> 02:23.350
the registration page

03:02.520 --> 03:09.940
now our locking method has been created when a function is run in but it will be disabled.

03:10.830 --> 03:18.970
And then when it did or from data if what edition is successful email and password will be attached

03:18.980 --> 03:28.350
as a request body and post it to the link or here and then we wait for a response from unserer and it

03:28.350 --> 03:35.500
will be assigned to the variable data then we would check if success on data is true.

03:36.390 --> 03:44.880
If success is true the user will be locked in and he'll be redirected to the home page otherwise the

03:44.880 --> 03:47.980
error message from the Suroor be displayed.

03:48.570 --> 03:52.710
If an error occurs the error message should be disabled.

03:52.710 --> 03:56.320
Once this is finished the button we enable again.

03:56.340 --> 03:59.700
Now let's open up our press a service

04:23.700 --> 04:24.390
here.

04:24.560 --> 04:31.650
Create the get hitter's method which returns a hash Dupee hitter really useful authorization to get

04:31.650 --> 04:39.150
hater's might be included as a hater in both the get and host method inside of the rest service.

04:39.150 --> 04:46.380
Now let's go back to our looking component and are going to change here three thousand two part tree

04:46.430 --> 04:47.330
oak tree.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.230
It's safe and there we have it.

04:50.600 --> 04:56.660
And this we have set of the logic required for looking at computers in the next video we're set up to

04:56.680 --> 04:58.580
I lay out for our component.
