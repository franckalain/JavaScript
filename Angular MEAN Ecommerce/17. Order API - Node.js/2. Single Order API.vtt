00:00.610 --> 00:03.230
Holga will come back in this video.

00:03.220 --> 00:05.090
We're going to do a single or API.

00:05.170 --> 00:06.580
So go ahead and do that.

00:06.610 --> 00:14.920
Now what we can copy this entire thing to copy pieces here and then we're going to have or are going

00:14.920 --> 00:15.160
to get.

00:15.160 --> 00:21.680
I actually we're going to change this to parents.

00:21.900 --> 00:24.870
I can change this to.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.030
And as well as I want to do.

00:27.030 --> 00:28.310
Fine wine.

00:28.330 --> 00:39.850
We want to fine all we want order that's it so extra We need to do is we have to do deep populate the

00:40.630 --> 00:44.010
hard right and products dot product.

00:44.050 --> 00:46.750
And then you want to the.

00:47.220 --> 00:50.040
We want to populate the orange field.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.770
So the next thing we can do is we're going to go to order.

00:52.780 --> 00:53.850
Yes.

00:53.920 --> 01:01.080
And actually we're going to get a product and we're going to copy the populate and go to order in PCB

01:01.180 --> 01:02.170
here.

01:02.440 --> 01:14.080
And then we will add that plug into orders or just want play again and then Hasen park you really want

01:14.080 --> 01:15.440
to go back to economy.

01:15.440 --> 01:16.960
Yes.

01:17.260 --> 01:18.990
And I think that's about it.

01:19.090 --> 01:21.190
Let's go ahead and test this.

01:21.310 --> 01:31.040
So let's go to postman and let's open up a new tab and just copy this up here.

01:31.370 --> 01:39.200
And at the IBM for example let's go back here and go ahead and get one of the Order ID for orders.

01:39.460 --> 01:52.720
Let's get the first one car reduce here pieces here and we're going to we have to pass in the in

01:55.750 --> 01:56.920
Trese in

01:59.840 --> 02:01.970
your piece here.

02:02.050 --> 02:03.400
Let's go ahead and click.

02:04.980 --> 02:13.160
And there you have it be specific order and it's CS orders so go ahead and tweet that graphical error.

02:13.180 --> 02:21.570
So it is change from orders to order and change to suit.

02:22.040 --> 02:26.370
Or does this just go back to postman send again

02:30.660 --> 02:32.970
and do you are that order.

02:33.200 --> 02:40.670
So we are getting our single order from the least of orders before is what we did was we are getting

02:40.700 --> 02:46.280
all the orders but now we are only getting a single or so they can see what kind of products you pre-Chase

02:46.280 --> 02:47.180
and so on.

02:47.570 --> 02:48.680
So this about it.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.390
And I'll see you guys in the next section.
