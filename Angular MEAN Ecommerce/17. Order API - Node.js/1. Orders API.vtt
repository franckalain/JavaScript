00:00.540 --> 00:02.510
Hello guys will come back in this video.

00:02.510 --> 00:04.450
We're going to build the orders API.

00:04.560 --> 00:05.780
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:06.060 --> 00:07.410
Let's get a visual studio.

00:07.740 --> 00:10.130
And you want to go to use your dog Jake.

00:10.360 --> 00:16.190
So actually it counted as routes and what do you want to scroll down.

00:17.100 --> 00:24.290
And you want to create the API belongs to users so we need to create it under ecology Yes.

00:24.300 --> 00:25.140
So go ahead and do the

00:54.440 --> 01:01.970
basic.

01:02.260 --> 01:04.190
So what is going on is very straightforward.

01:04.210 --> 01:09.850
We pass in the GMAT because we want to get the requester decoded so that you can search for only a few

01:10.870 --> 01:13.360
using the older schema.

01:13.360 --> 01:17.210
So we want to find all the orders belong to the owner.

01:17.590 --> 01:21.610
So we repassing passing the request and the code it doesn't use or does underscore.

01:21.850 --> 01:27.550
And we want to populate the products and products and as well as the owner of the product because we

01:27.550 --> 01:33.070
want to get all the information and if we run exec and if there's an error a success falls couldn't

01:33.070 --> 01:41.160
find an order else success true funny or and we just want to do to go ahead and test it before we test.

01:41.170 --> 01:42.250
I made a mistake.

01:42.250 --> 01:46.410
This one should be orders because it has to be the same as this one of course.

01:46.720 --> 01:51.050
And we see if there's And finally we need to import or to schema.

01:51.380 --> 02:00.670
So as we go up and copy this entire thing copy pizza here and change to order.

02:01.190 --> 02:03.770
And this is to order as well.

02:03.770 --> 02:11.800
So the next thing we need to do is we want to open up our power shelves so go ahead and click shif open

02:11.810 --> 02:24.830
boat show and then see the Amazon all the server and run the server.

02:24.870 --> 02:25.400
All right.

02:25.470 --> 02:31.150
So the next thing we want to do is we want to open up postman so go here folks in

02:35.260 --> 02:41.200
and we definitely have to log in using Pierian and G-mail com because that's what Adam Peterson used

02:41.620 --> 02:43.000
in a previous section.

02:43.030 --> 02:48.050
So as you go to API icons log in and go to very good time.

02:48.410 --> 03:05.380
You know write in and ask for you mean you get a call and the password is 1 2 3 4 5 and submit and I'm

03:05.390 --> 03:15.040
going to get all the talking copy and it will open up a new tack and type in a local pulse into the

03:15.750 --> 03:17.570
accounts.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.040
All right.

03:19.900 --> 03:28.640
And then you want to get headers authorization because we're parsing a token and we want to send and

03:28.640 --> 03:33.550
day you have it all the orders that Derian imported in the last section.

03:33.740 --> 03:37.340
So we have let's check out your product.

03:37.490 --> 03:41.980
The products are intelligent rubber mouse of course.

03:41.980 --> 03:45.420
And then we have every reading and then we have.

03:45.420 --> 03:52.450
And the problem is and then we have gorgeous to table and everything is good.

03:52.850 --> 04:00.700
So we test everything so it shows up the products that we just pre-Chase and that's good.

04:01.130 --> 04:01.960
Awesome.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.760
I'll see you in the next video where we actually get to you know get in a specific order one by one

04:07.980 --> 04:08.700
or CD-R's.
