00:00.670 --> 00:03.380
We forgot to add something really important.

00:03.430 --> 00:04.720
It is a middleware.

00:04.960 --> 00:13.630
So this middleware will help the front end to communicate with the server side because server side and

00:13.630 --> 00:19.840
the front end are two separate things or two separate or for example the server side have port 3000

00:20.350 --> 00:24.710
while the front end has maybe or 4200.

00:24.730 --> 00:30.550
So in order for the front end to communicate smoothly to the front to the back and we need to add a

00:30.560 --> 00:38.020
middle word called Course course stands for cross origin resource sharing.

00:38.130 --> 00:46.530
It is something that is declared by the WTC on communication between different domains by coarse communications

00:46.530 --> 00:53.430
between the same domain will be allowed the users and the communication that Ross originated will be

00:53.430 --> 01:02.130
restricted to a few techniques we can see these when we are talking to API mostly the rest API will

01:02.550 --> 01:04.480
may give us an area.

01:04.580 --> 01:10.380
This is because the server and client sites are on different domains and the communication between them

01:10.950 --> 01:13.400
are restricted by horse rules.

01:13.740 --> 01:20.320
So in order for us to make front and the back can communicate smoothly we need to add this additional

01:20.460 --> 01:21.100
middleware.

01:21.390 --> 01:22.380
So go ahead and do that.

01:22.380 --> 01:34.690
So it was good to show and be in store for that.

01:34.860 --> 01:36.380
So now we have finish installed.

01:36.390 --> 01:41.370
Go back to the server Yes and elicited quite a fall here because.

01:41.400 --> 01:45.970
Conte's so close to a couple more

01:50.140 --> 01:52.550
Im going to use

01:57.960 --> 01:59.110
and thats about it.

01:59.130 --> 02:04.740
Once we added this then we now are going to receive any area from the front end whenever you try to

02:04.740 --> 02:12.090
make an API call to the server you will never have like an area like you know Course request problem

02:12.090 --> 02:12.870
and so on.

02:13.200 --> 02:20.700
So hopefully you guys enjoyed this you do and you know I'll see you guys in the next couple of sections

02:21.090 --> 02:21.420
by.
