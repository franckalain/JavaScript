00:00.940 --> 00:06.190
In of video we learn how to install dependencies using NPM.

00:06.190 --> 00:09.690
Now we will learn how to use the you know code.

00:09.850 --> 00:14.940
First of all you need to make sure you are in servers folder if you are in.

00:14.950 --> 00:17.800
Open up your favorite text editor.

00:17.890 --> 00:20.880
My favorite text editor is Visual Studio.

00:21.280 --> 00:30.910
So we used to decode and you want to drag the entire project folder which is Amazonas to your text editor.

00:31.060 --> 00:37.690
Now you want to click here and you want to right click on the server and you want to create a new file

00:38.170 --> 00:40.730
and you want to give a name server.

00:41.140 --> 00:43.780
Yes.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.750
The next thing we need to do is to get all the dependencies that we just install.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.310
So let's go ahead and cons

01:15.690 --> 01:21.270
require is a function to get the dependencies in other programming languages like Python or Ruby.

01:21.270 --> 01:32.040
You easily use import Express for example or express or or.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.000
In a nutshell require is slight import.

01:36.170 --> 01:43.790
So in this so I've explained explain to you guys what each of the dependency does express is a web framework

01:43.910 --> 01:49.300
you can create routes like get Bowse or to be more specific you are l.

01:49.700 --> 01:57.820
It is a framework to create Hastey to be Rupp's Morgan is he she to be requests logger for.

01:57.930 --> 01:58.370
No no.

01:58.390 --> 02:06.200
Yes it is a middleware it simplifies the process of logging requests to your application Nexxus body

02:06.200 --> 02:14.240
parser but the parser is actually a data reader so technically even an install body parser no jast cannot

02:14.240 --> 02:17.190
really communicate with the front and data.

02:17.240 --> 02:23.090
For example if you want to log in and you want to pass in your username and password no jazz has to

02:23.090 --> 02:27.350
understand what kind of data is that to be able to do something with it.

02:27.440 --> 02:33.070
Finally is mongoose mongoose a Mongolia region.

02:33.200 --> 02:40.010
So now you can communicate directly from non-jazz to the Maunganui database within easy to use user

02:40.100 --> 02:41.040
interface.

02:41.280 --> 02:45.220
You'll see the power of mongoose later on.

02:45.450 --> 02:52.320
Now we need to teach our non-jazz on how to use all these dependencies to do so we need to create an

02:52.410 --> 03:01.280
instance of express dependencies so go ahead and do that cons Express once created.

03:01.290 --> 03:02.220
Now we can use that.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.150
So to use

03:30.110 --> 03:30.530
this

03:33.410 --> 03:38.950
first line is simply reading data in a specific format which is adjacent format.

03:38.950 --> 03:46.760
Second line is your uncoated is we put as false because in future we want to read an image as well.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.180
It can read all sort of data types.

03:49.380 --> 03:55.100
Finally is Morgon which will lock out all the requests on the terminal.

03:55.500 --> 04:01.230
I know right now it is very subjective but as we dive in more you'll understand why do we need all these

04:01.230 --> 04:03.630
dependencies in this video.

04:03.870 --> 04:04.930
We will learn.

04:05.010 --> 04:10.490
I mean sorry in this video we learn how to import the dependencies in the next video.

04:10.860 --> 04:13.420
We will run our first server.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.630
I'll see you guys in next few.
