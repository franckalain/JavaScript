00:02.460 --> 00:07.190

00:07.230 --> 00:10.110
We don't need to set up to be on a local machine.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.070
It will take us a lot of time.

00:12.090 --> 00:15.180
So instead we use a cloud moblie database.

00:15.240 --> 00:19.690

00:20.010 --> 00:30.520

00:48.830 --> 00:55.420

01:15.380 --> 01:18.960
So now I want to keep your Amazon out of the question.

01:19.070 --> 01:21.090

01:21.430 --> 01:26.150
When Italy uses that and then you want to add data base and you want to give a name.

01:26.150 --> 01:28.570
For me I'm going to type my name because.

01:28.580 --> 01:29.310

01:29.570 --> 01:39.230
Arash abash Rubina's you entry you want to try to create you have to create a user for this database.

01:39.230 --> 01:40.810
So we have it already.

01:40.820 --> 01:44.120
So now we can just copy tousling.

01:44.290 --> 01:49.620
Now we have already have a database just copy using and pasted on our you know G-S application.
