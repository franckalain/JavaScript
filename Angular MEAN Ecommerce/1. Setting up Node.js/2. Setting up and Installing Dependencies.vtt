Hello guys will come back in order for us to build a food application with many features we need to

00:08.200 --> 00:12.970
teach and know jazz on how to learn a specific skill.

00:13.030 --> 00:20.470
For example if we want to teach and know G-S on how to create a new R L No we need to start express

00:20.740 --> 00:24.810
framework if we want to teach and non-jazz on how to read.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.690
Jason data that we need to teach.

00:27.730 --> 00:31.780
No just body parts are the most skills we teach.

00:31.790 --> 00:32.750
No yes.

00:32.920 --> 00:35.670
The more intelligent it becomes.

00:36.100 --> 00:41.920
In this video we will install all the dependencies that no just need right now.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.140
So what are you waiting for.

00:45.730 --> 00:51.200
The shell and installed all the important dependencies so glitches.

00:51.260 --> 00:55.500
And right click and click Open power shall we do here.

00:56.600 --> 01:03.500
So the first thing we want to do is we want to create a folder but before that we need to store one

01:03.500 --> 01:06.750
specific library and we need to solve.

01:07.020 --> 01:12.760
Norton Norton is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your code.

01:12.850 --> 01:17.900
The install note when we run NPM install Norton dash G.

01:18.070 --> 01:22.250
So we install bash

01:25.420 --> 01:31.360
dash stands for Global so that every no jazz project can use it.

01:36.980 --> 01:37.720
Done.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.370
So you want to clear everything.

01:39.420 --> 01:41.910
So we already install anointment.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.020
Next thing we want to do is we want to create a new folder and give it a name.

01:46.020 --> 01:47.580
Amazonas.

01:48.210 --> 01:50.610
This will be our project folder.

01:50.730 --> 01:59.050
You can create it on desktop or whichever directory you are comfortable with CD into this folder see

01:59.560 --> 02:06.110
Amazon know and create a folder and give it a name server.

02:06.240 --> 02:15.160
So make directory server for no guesswork work specifically in service folder so CD into the server

02:16.030 --> 02:19.650
and we won't install all the core dependencies for no G-S.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.220
Before that we need to type in NPM.

02:22.870 --> 02:24.870
We want to initialize the package.

02:24.870 --> 02:25.580
Jay Sean.

02:25.580 --> 02:30.690
So I mean ridging one.

02:32.620 --> 02:36.460
I don't know that now is the answer.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.260
Yes

02:42.600 --> 02:44.810
yes everything's stalled.

02:45.030 --> 02:49.350
So now we want to install all the port and dependencies which will reinstall

02:51.850 --> 03:02.740
somebody parser and see instead of using dash G.

03:02.780 --> 03:09.870
We want to use dash dash save to save all the dependencies only for a specific project which is Surve

03:09.870 --> 03:10.780
folder.

03:11.190 --> 03:15.900
So we have installed every important dependency for the time being.

03:15.900 --> 03:23.040
So in this video we learn how to create folders install all the important events in the next review.

03:23.240 --> 03:28.610
Will we will learn how to use the dependencies and what each dependency does specifically.
