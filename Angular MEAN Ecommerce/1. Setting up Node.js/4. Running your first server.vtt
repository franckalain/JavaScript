00:01.200 --> 00:06.100
In order for people to use your app you need to run to surface in this video.

00:06.120 --> 00:09.980
We will learn how to run our first server and our first.

00:10.070 --> 00:13.970
Hey should you keep your route or in another name API.

00:14.250 --> 00:16.730
So it's go under right below here.

00:16.780 --> 00:20.020
I've listened to one or two

00:37.740 --> 00:43.440
let's run out a no job application so I'm going to open up my Rasho.

00:43.780 --> 00:50.750
So here I'm going since you don't need to at one time.

00:50.770 --> 00:51.910
No.

00:52.630 --> 01:00.490
So if you use only know whenever you make any changes to your code it will never restart certainly self

01:01.490 --> 01:05.600
but let's consider this if you do it.

01:06.530 --> 01:08.530
OK now we have this problem.

01:08.540 --> 01:15.830
The term not moon is not recognized as the name of the command that functions to file or operable program.

01:15.830 --> 01:19.210
So we have this we called it paff problem.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.250
So you need to verify what are your paff is correct or not.

01:22.550 --> 01:30.850
So it good to hear and when to tap into this PC right click properties and then you want to advance

01:32.650 --> 01:41.510
the password and then you when it click environment variables and then pass at it and then you want

01:41.510 --> 01:46.450
to view it in this way you get to typing like this one.

01:46.640 --> 01:56.210
The total then and I add to your past so that only you can use.

01:56.720 --> 01:57.900
OK.

01:58.020 --> 01:58.850
All right.

01:59.290 --> 02:00.300
So you to go there.

02:00.500 --> 02:01.480
Exactly.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.600
And then you want to go back to your or I'll show

02:07.550 --> 02:09.010
you sir.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.050
The other thing.

02:11.090 --> 02:11.940
And then what happened.

02:11.950 --> 02:13.990
No sir.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.670
And now it runs perfectly.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.070
So it will restart you know whenever you make any changes.

02:20.090 --> 02:23.020
So for example if you go to your code and you at

02:27.250 --> 02:30.850
you see it and it automatically restarts.

02:30.850 --> 02:31.580
Awesome.

02:31.900 --> 02:34.690
So let's go back to all we're doing this

02:37.720 --> 02:40.150
congratulation and build your first server.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.200
Now it runs.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.150
Magic happens from port to the tourney.

02:44.170 --> 02:46.060
Really proud of you guys.

02:46.060 --> 02:51.220
I have a feeling that one of you guys are going to change the world soon huh.

02:51.610 --> 02:54.550
I know you guys are going to change the world soon enough.

02:54.550 --> 02:55.810
One of the guys.

02:55.900 --> 02:57.480
So now let's move on.

02:57.490 --> 03:01.310
Next step is to create our first issue to be rock.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.450
So go and do that.

03:02.740 --> 03:04.070
So in the middle of here.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.300
STOP of get

03:09.150 --> 03:10.750
us on this

03:22.060 --> 03:25.280
save this and then we want to test this route.

03:25.400 --> 03:25.910
OK.

03:26.720 --> 03:35.130
So let's go ahead and go to our Google Group and type in to the polls to the poll.

03:35.620 --> 03:38.260
It was show user Arash Yahaya.

03:38.330 --> 03:45.740
So technically we are using one of the hishe method which is get get is just getting data from this

03:45.750 --> 03:47.530
rock that said.

03:47.660 --> 03:55.330
So technically we passing a rap name which in our case will be for example of done example.

03:56.090 --> 04:04.490
It is the same as this because you can see local's to the to the slash it will still be the same.

04:04.960 --> 04:11.460
And then we pass in let's move this for us and then we pass in a callback function with the parameters

04:11.470 --> 04:20.200
a request response and next and then we turn a Jason data format and we give it a user object which

04:20.200 --> 04:23.130
is which de-value is our Achaia.

04:23.170 --> 04:29.740
So in a nutshell whenever someone visits this history Berat it will simply return a Jason data.

04:31.280 --> 04:38.330
In this video we learn on how to run our first server and as well as our first Hastey be around in the

04:38.330 --> 04:41.740
next video we will set up our cloud Mowgli account.

04:41.810 --> 04:43.020
I'll see you guys next.
