WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:07.670
In this video we will set up our configuration and we will organize our data be Celine outport number

00:07.830 --> 00:10.080
and finding the secret key.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.420
So just go ahead and do that.

00:11.430 --> 00:13.200
So let's go back to our studio.

00:13.590 --> 00:16.110
And you want to create a new file and give it a name.

00:16.110 --> 00:16.840
Coffee.

00:16.980 --> 00:18.120
Yes.

00:18.680 --> 00:19.900
So.

00:20.440 --> 00:21.800
Yes.

00:21.900 --> 00:23.260
And write the code right now.

00:31.530 --> 00:35.690
Riesling or number

00:45.980 --> 00:47.660
see this.

00:47.700 --> 00:51.090
So we want to go back to and lap and you want to copy this entire thing.

00:53.220 --> 01:01.310
Go back to your studio and you want a piece here and let's make it bigger and Duleep this

01:06.400 --> 01:18.470
will be in this tree and a port number would be to be saved this module to export is a mean exporting

01:18.740 --> 01:20.130
this entire file.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.930
So out of file can use it.

01:21.940 --> 01:23.030
So it is give it a try.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.890
So as good servant a jackass.

01:24.950 --> 01:30.400
And right here is filled with water.

01:31.700 --> 01:35.740
So is how we actually acquire or import a local file.

01:35.790 --> 01:39.770
So since Coffey's under Server you know server folder.

01:39.860 --> 01:42.270
So we just do dot slash fake.

01:42.290 --> 01:49.880
So let's see if it's in under module then you want to do is Conficker

01:53.690 --> 01:58.870
So now you know we want to change this to come up.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.330
OK.

02:00.740 --> 02:06.420
And you want to move this as a Perfect.

02:06.860 --> 02:10.640
So right now we haven't seen this Folliard source Guto terminal.

02:10.970 --> 02:17.930
And I know that this now Mangi happened some 20 30 years ago.

02:17.960 --> 02:28.670
And she says to key or sieved is still going to be the same as happened or awesome to the Toti.

02:28.810 --> 02:35.270
So we managed to export the port number and you know we mentioned export days and type thing.

02:35.620 --> 02:40.670
So the next thing we want to do is we want to set up the database since we're already importante mongooses

02:40.690 --> 02:41.960
dependency.

02:41.980 --> 02:47.880
Now we can let our express application communicate directly to use Mangieri database.

02:48.030 --> 02:48.940
So it is good to serve it.

02:49.000 --> 02:49.660
Yes.

02:49.690 --> 02:55.060
And right below here we're top in the mongooses can nag.

02:55.420 --> 03:01.330
And then again since we already put it in context you asked the link so we can.

03:01.510 --> 03:15.850
So we can just go back here and type in config database and you want to type in about is better

03:24.580 --> 03:39.070
to be part of this and was good to our turn and boom connected to database mongers that connect is a

03:39.070 --> 03:43.610
function to communicate directly to Moli database.

03:43.630 --> 03:50.500
In case we are communicating with the cloud to be data base and then we pass a callback function or

03:50.620 --> 03:52.180
we call it aero function.

03:52.600 --> 03:57.880
And then if there's an error you want to log the error else else you want to show connect it to the

03:57.880 --> 03:58.660
database.

03:58.810 --> 04:06.040
If you are at this stage meaning we are success we are already successfully connected to that database.

04:06.280 --> 04:12.320
In this video we learn on how to organize our database swing part number secret key.

04:12.400 --> 04:20.740
And finally we managed to you know connect our no gas to the amount of utilities in the next section.

04:20.740 --> 04:24.140
Adam Peterson We will walk you guys to the Anglo part.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.610
He will set up dangler and so on.

04:26.630 --> 04:29.710
He's an awesome instructor and you guys will often.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.710
I'll see you in next section later on by.
