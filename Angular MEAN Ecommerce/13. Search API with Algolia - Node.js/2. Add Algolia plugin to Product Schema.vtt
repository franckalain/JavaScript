00:00.540 --> 00:08.400
Hello guys will come back in this video we will learn how to add a good idea to our product schema so

00:08.400 --> 00:15.160
that it will see in the products in the moment to be database to the cloud part in real time.

00:15.180 --> 00:18.510
So the first thing we need to do is we need to install a new dependency.

00:18.810 --> 00:23.810
So what we do is we want to go to our polls show even a cancerous

00:26.580 --> 00:33.820
and first thing we do is we want to do and we install mongoose the dash dash see

00:39.400 --> 00:41.670
now we want to importante the Pennsy.

00:41.930 --> 00:48.870
So let's go to product G-S under Morell's souls go to here.

00:49.110 --> 00:49.780
We use to do

00:53.200 --> 00:54.570
lot.

00:54.730 --> 00:59.480
And the first thing you want to do is the cons one

01:02.520 --> 01:09.170
goes to boy or girl the.

01:09.360 --> 01:14.670
Now we want to add the plug in the mongoose plugin to a product schema.

01:14.750 --> 01:19.370
So go ahead and do it right here on time.

01:27.620 --> 01:33.450
For me I want to because I don't want to waste your time.

01:33.670 --> 01:36.580
So you can see this all the attributes that we're going to add.

01:36.790 --> 01:40.690
What we haven't added the value because some of the values that we need to take from people go to Web

01:40.690 --> 01:41.440
site.

01:41.620 --> 01:45.850
So it was good to go to the Web site and I'm going to copy this

01:48.740 --> 01:53.750
here and download a copy of this piece here.

01:53.980 --> 01:59.060
And even daks name is you want to go to the diocese and then it has to be the same as this one.

01:59.080 --> 02:04.140
So I'm just going to copy them just click this copy here.

02:04.330 --> 02:09.480
The selector is I mean the name or for example they actually use the new one.

02:09.610 --> 02:16.450
I'll go to to actually select for example like name title you know images and so on.

02:16.450 --> 02:21.420
So go ahead and top it off.

02:21.930 --> 02:25.010
You need to

02:33.140 --> 02:34.670
populate.

02:34.730 --> 02:37.360
We want to populate That's name.

02:37.390 --> 02:44.500
Is simple like mongooses want to populate owner and reviews and you want to select and name and reading

02:45.240 --> 02:52.750
for example right from the information of the populate once populated to the owner and revues.

02:52.780 --> 03:02.050
We want to select a name from the owner and rating from the next issue and type order.

03:05.780 --> 03:27.420
Thanks.

03:31.700 --> 03:41.970
So the average rating we get to actually copy from this copy it is something pieced here but the only

03:41.970 --> 03:45.070
difference is is you want to change this duff

03:55.560 --> 04:01.770
and since we have virtual So you want to copy this name and paste into some letters because we want

04:01.770 --> 04:04.790
average reading to be part of it as well.

04:06.160 --> 04:06.670
Finally

04:11.980 --> 04:18.440
subjects are going to go through it one by one again ID it's just an idea of Ogilvy and APHC same thing

04:18.750 --> 04:26.150
in next name will be the name in this in diciest So it is going to be on the one selector is as I said

04:26.240 --> 04:31.040
we want to select all the attributes that we want to send to you.

04:31.450 --> 04:38.900
But I tile EMH reviews description price owner created in every tree from the rituals and every one

04:38.930 --> 04:40.900
property owner and reviews.

04:40.940 --> 04:46.760
And we want to select name from owner rating from the default would be the altar and the value would

04:46.760 --> 04:48.040
be a note.

04:48.050 --> 04:53.620
So for mapping is when you want to modify something for example if you want to add you know like to

04:53.630 --> 04:55.660
title for example you want to highlight.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.230
Hello my name is.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.030
And then title.

04:58.070 --> 04:59.540
So you can't actually do that.

04:59.630 --> 05:07.830
You can actually do and no my name is and this will be the title that you're going to get from Ogleby

05:07.830 --> 05:08.390
itself.

05:08.390 --> 05:11.510
So it's going to be Hello my name is and then the name of the title.

05:11.510 --> 05:14.450
For example test the great night chicken for example.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.660
So you can actually do this.

05:16.720 --> 05:18.800
I'm just going to leave it as de-value self.

05:18.820 --> 05:24.300
And finally it's rituals we want to add the average rating for every product on that as well.

05:24.550 --> 05:31.210
So this is the reason why we at this and the book is you know if you're running your server on production

05:31.710 --> 05:36.580
do you want to turn off the book because you don't want to like you know you want to see all the you

05:36.580 --> 05:39.880
want to only turn it on is in all the on production.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.660
I mean only on localhost when you are developing it.

05:42.820 --> 05:43.430
So that's it.

05:44.520 --> 05:50.730
So the final step that we need to take is we want to put mongoose model into a variable we want to put

05:50.730 --> 05:52.630
this into a variable.

05:52.920 --> 06:08.740
So we want to remove We want to cut this new model this and then we want to do it all.

06:10.000 --> 06:10.320
You

06:14.110 --> 06:17.460
set up

06:22.470 --> 06:29.050
that's your goal.

06:30.950 --> 06:35.660
And finally you want to add more.

06:36.090 --> 06:41.670
So the reason why we are doing this because you know we need to add additional mongooses of a feature

06:42.270 --> 06:45.810
to the model itself which is the product schema.

06:45.810 --> 06:49.230
The first one is to sing to our goal.

06:49.470 --> 06:56.510
So every time a seller created a product Aglaea was straight away seeing the newly created data in them

06:56.510 --> 07:00.250
over the database straight to the goal itself.

07:00.330 --> 07:01.610
You'll see it actually wrong.

07:01.740 --> 07:03.010
It is really amazing.

07:05.030 --> 07:11.030
So next thing is this is the part where you actually want to search for example like this is what you

07:11.030 --> 07:14.230
want to search on the search engine itself.

07:14.540 --> 07:16.040
What do you want to put in.

07:16.060 --> 07:22.220
So the key what we are putting is title as this search will actually be you can at more for example

07:22.220 --> 07:28.870
if you want to search by mange and so on.

07:29.030 --> 07:34.040
But it's better we just search by how to make our lives easier.

07:34.040 --> 07:41.250
So let's run this server and check the storage to see what it actually sings or not.

07:41.270 --> 07:43.190
So go ahead and do this.

07:43.460 --> 07:43.620
No

07:46.890 --> 07:47.880
server.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.370
Going to see ugly forms for example magic happens.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.430
Awesome.

08:03.930 --> 08:09.220
You haven't updated settings to zone all clear index synchronize next.

08:09.220 --> 08:11.640
So do two hour.

08:11.940 --> 08:14.400
And then those go ahead and refresh the speech

08:17.980 --> 08:25.100
day you have it all the title object id and then all the attributes like EMH description price owner

08:25.540 --> 08:29.050
and as well as the average rate team.

08:29.180 --> 08:30.570
Awesome.

08:30.620 --> 08:34.280
And one more thing that we populates it didn't name.

08:34.610 --> 08:37.490
And reviews will be Liron Once you have review.

08:37.760 --> 08:44.600
So we populate the path we choose the owner path and we select only name to be part of this awesome

08:45.090 --> 08:46.090
next video.

08:46.100 --> 08:50.130
We will learn how to create a search API based on Ogola.

08:50.270 --> 08:52.250
I'll see you guys in the next video.
