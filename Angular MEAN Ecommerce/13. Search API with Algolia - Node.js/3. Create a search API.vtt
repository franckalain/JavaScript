Hello guys in this video we'll create a search API before we do that.

00:05.880 --> 00:13.750
We saw the official I'll call the search depends and so you a Google search.

00:13.910 --> 00:17.520
Is this the official dependency from Elgood itself.

00:18.730 --> 00:19.570
All right done.

00:19.810 --> 00:25.160
So the next thing you want to do is we want to go to used to you and you want to go to Ross folder and

00:25.160 --> 00:30.170
right click on it and you file the search right.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.030
Yes.

00:32.030 --> 00:36.810
So now we want to call on broader employer

00:41.070 --> 00:49.540
than Google search and go to war.

00:49.870 --> 00:49.940
The

00:53.090 --> 00:59.180
next thing comes to mind google search

01:02.200 --> 01:03.420
and the apps

01:06.050 --> 01:15.920
and comments index and client dot the index and name which we can and we don't know the name of the

01:16.220 --> 01:18.260
one of the diocese.

01:18.500 --> 01:29.560
So we want to go to our product and yes were copying a piece here and go back here copies that type

01:29.600 --> 01:33.290
of thing.

01:35.030 --> 01:43.490
So this systemically we need this because today we can actually search the Amazon No dice data for example

01:43.490 --> 01:45.010
like title and so on.

01:45.260 --> 01:51.170
So in order for us to do that we just need to do that search and then we can search all the data.

01:51.170 --> 01:54.580
We do this Amazonas and dice that's it.

01:54.800 --> 01:58.680
So we go out and create our API water.

02:00.140 --> 02:02.790
And what's next

02:06.130 --> 02:15.620
is going to be where you are where you got where you want to index.

02:15.620 --> 02:25.360
I mean if there is actually not and you're no Dan we want to do the index search that index search and

02:25.360 --> 02:29.880
then pass the query itself which is to see what we should do.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.950
We're in the dark

02:34.930 --> 02:48.280
and that will be the pitch.

02:49.200 --> 02:57.660
So search takes on certain

03:05.890 --> 03:06.360
it is

03:26.430 --> 03:33.630
done a piece for me in search of in dice and it will pass in the query and the page number and then

03:33.780 --> 03:38.360
it will be a callback or an arrow function with an error and content.

03:38.370 --> 03:44.670
So once you searching dice or see the title will be tasty and then it will actually return with that

03:44.680 --> 03:46.930
Jason format the content.

03:47.170 --> 03:52.260
See if it matches any of the data in the index itself.

03:52.260 --> 03:53.950
So let's give it a shot.

03:54.120 --> 04:09.480
So now we want to support routers and when we do serve guess one of capitis this here and you want to

04:09.480 --> 04:15.030
change the skewed a certain route.

04:15.750 --> 04:23.990
You want to just search and copy this here.

04:26.180 --> 04:32.000
So this is going to be a search ropes.

04:32.260 --> 04:37.350
So it's good for our show and Les Paul Ramos's

04:45.090 --> 04:52.670
So go ahead and go to our postman and open you up and we'll go over to the

04:55.950 --> 04:59.230
search and then it's going to be get.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.820
So we want to pass.

05:02.500 --> 05:07.580
Were you close to for example let's make sure you

05:11.710 --> 05:21.270
get there you have the search and the content will be tasty wouldn't sell or tasty and all has tasty

05:21.270 --> 05:22.220
and tasty.

05:22.440 --> 05:25.550
So go ahead and do it.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.280
And you can see.

05:29.310 --> 05:31.140
You didn't see it.

05:31.430 --> 05:32.630
It is accurate.

05:32.930 --> 05:34.210
Awesome.

05:34.220 --> 05:35.170
In the next video.

05:35.210 --> 05:41.650
Adam Peterson will walk it true on how to build the search from and I'll see you guys in the next section.
