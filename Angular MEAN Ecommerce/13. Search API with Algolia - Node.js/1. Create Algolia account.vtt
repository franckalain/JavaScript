Hello guys in this section we will learn how to build a search feature.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.250
Imagine a world without Google.

00:08.390 --> 00:12.050
It would be almost impossible for us to search for something.

00:12.050 --> 00:14.300
Same goes for a web application.

00:14.300 --> 00:22.030
We need to add a search functionality so the user could search for a product in this video we will create

00:22.030 --> 00:24.290
an elderly account.

00:24.460 --> 00:27.760
It's Ogola is a cloud search infrastructure.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.430
You don't need to create your own search engine for a web application.

00:31.630 --> 00:34.940
You can use Google to solve this problem.

00:35.230 --> 00:37.000
Let's go to the Web site.

00:37.030 --> 00:47.010
So you type in the top and then I'm going to click again because I create the account you simply just

00:47.010 --> 00:50.550
click Google or get up if you have a Google account or get an account for me.

00:50.560 --> 00:55.410
I can't I'm just going to click this.

00:55.840 --> 00:56.340
All right.

00:56.430 --> 01:04.190
So here's the interface we have dashboard in Dyce's and now thinks the API keys and you can check team

01:04.200 --> 01:04.760
as well.

01:12.820 --> 01:15.530
Essential for business and underprice.

01:15.830 --> 01:17.540
We're not going to great now.

01:17.540 --> 01:19.490
You just can use a sandbox.

01:19.510 --> 01:25.840
So the first thing you want to do is you want to do this and you want to create a new index and then

01:25.840 --> 01:27.150
you want to give it a name.

01:27.190 --> 01:38.640
Amazon on Version 1 create create index and Kirlian don't have any data yet because when you do that

01:38.640 --> 01:44.880
in a couple of next week in and that we do actually we're going to add or to be more specific seeing

01:45.390 --> 01:51.020
the data in the database to our goal the cloud storage.

01:51.030 --> 01:57.660
So now what you need to do is you want to go to API Kean's and on what you need to do is you want to

01:57.660 --> 02:03.440
copy this and you want to copy this is well on the spot.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.870
So that's about it in the next video.

02:05.890 --> 02:12.130
We will install a library call or a dependency call mongoose or go here so that we could start using

02:12.130 --> 02:14.050
the search engine infrastructure.

02:14.350 --> 02:16.020
I'll see you guys in the next Vitti.
