Hello guys will come back in this video we will create a logging API so go ahead and do that.

00:07.700 --> 00:09.340
So right go here.

00:09.520 --> 00:14.220
What's up in

02:14.990 --> 02:19.780
this get it done here.

02:52.870 --> 02:54.790
We are doing a post method.

02:55.120 --> 03:02.060
Find one instantly a function by mongoose that will search for one particular document that has the

03:02.060 --> 03:09.610
specific attribute which in our case again email attribute the use is No.

03:09.820 --> 03:12.820
Then we want to do is one response with a message.

03:12.880 --> 03:22.030
A dedication field use it in fun else if a user exists then we want to do is you want to compare a password

03:22.030 --> 03:26.190
that you typing with a password in the database.

03:26.290 --> 03:30.690
So if the password is not valid then you must show indication fail.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.790
You just send a wrong you're just typing the wrong password.

03:33.790 --> 03:41.380
For example else if the password is correct that you want to do JTB you want to encrypt the user's information

03:42.130 --> 03:51.490
and then you want a response success message and token so it was go ahead and test this new logging

03:51.510 --> 04:03.120
route so it's good to postman and change this to it was just copy this one and then change the Post

04:03.210 --> 04:04.930
body.

04:05.040 --> 04:19.600
Email me at your tree or dot com and if you want to carry or check password.

04:19.640 --> 04:25.760
Right right so it is good and send that emails already exist because you know why.

04:25.760 --> 04:31.080
Because you need to sign up since you do it and send it all the time.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.030
We have an error.

04:33.590 --> 04:35.160
Again so.

04:35.550 --> 04:37.280
Just go and do it again.

04:38.310 --> 04:39.650
OK I think in a while.

04:39.750 --> 04:40.910
Let's go back to views you do.

04:40.910 --> 04:43.630
And again we got to save this file.

04:43.640 --> 04:47.740
I was looking to see if it's a good way to post in check.

04:47.790 --> 04:51.120
All right everything's good said Boom.

04:51.190 --> 04:51.610
We got it.

04:51.610 --> 04:52.740
Enjoy talking.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.000
We successfully log in.

04:55.090 --> 05:00.820
So let's you know let's put the wrong past and see what it returns.

05:00.820 --> 05:04.100
Any error in a discussion you.

05:04.210 --> 05:05.370
Wrong password.

05:05.710 --> 05:12.180
So go ahead and you know this and say it again failed.

05:12.410 --> 05:14.980
Use it I found amazing.

05:15.070 --> 05:20.650
We managed to test every single if an else and we got the right result.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.950
In this video we learn how to create a log in API.

05:25.000 --> 05:34.060
We just finished our Kishan features where we learn how to build Sign-Up API logging API in the next

05:34.060 --> 05:35.080
section.

05:35.110 --> 05:38.540
Adam Peterson will walk you to on the front end part.

05:38.710 --> 05:41.050
