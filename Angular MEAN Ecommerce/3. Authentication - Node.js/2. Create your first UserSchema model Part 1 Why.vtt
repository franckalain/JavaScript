Every object in this world has attributes humans have name age job and so on.

00:08.970 --> 00:13.630
In this video we will learn why do we need user schema.

00:14.590 --> 00:16.330
Let's take a look at a diagram.

00:16.360 --> 00:21.890
This figure is a human being and he has a name drop and an H.

00:21.970 --> 00:24.860
So this human name is Batman.

00:24.880 --> 00:29.180
His age is 35 years old and his job is a superhero.

00:29.470 --> 00:34.850
So technically every user will have the same attributes just like in the figure.

00:34.990 --> 00:42.210
We need a Universo use a blueprint so that every user will have the same attributes.

00:42.490 --> 00:44.820
I want to show you guys another example.

00:46.350 --> 00:54.300
As you can see every user in Springfield will have the same set of attributes birthdate name address

00:54.630 --> 01:03.630
sex height weight and so on for example you know another example every user on Facebook has to enter

01:04.050 --> 01:06.540
his email and password to log in.

01:06.840 --> 01:12.990
But having the same set of attributes you can select which attributes that the user has to enter to

01:12.990 --> 01:16.880
log in to the web of a kitchen in the next few.

01:16.890 --> 01:23.250
We will learn on how to create the user schema and what sort of attributes that each user needs.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.230
I'll see guys in the next video.
