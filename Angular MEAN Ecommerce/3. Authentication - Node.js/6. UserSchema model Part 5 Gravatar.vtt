A picture is worth a thousand words without pictures it will be a boring website.

00:06.590 --> 00:07.540
Right.

00:07.580 --> 00:13.460
And this video we will learn how to add an image every time a users sign up.

00:13.610 --> 00:16.240
Let us continue where we left off.

00:16.730 --> 01:10.850
So right below here you are.

01:11.610 --> 01:13.930
To court court.

01:14.370 --> 01:18.760
So it has a built in no gas line.

01:19.170 --> 01:20.010
So we didn't install

02:10.100 --> 02:17.180
So technically there is a Web site API called Gravatar that will generate a generic picture and it is

02:17.210 --> 02:18.620
free to use.

02:18.680 --> 02:23.110
We are simply using the API to generate that image.

02:23.150 --> 02:29.660
So technically what is happening right now is we created another custom function or custom method and

02:29.660 --> 02:32.140
we get to name Gravatar.

02:32.330 --> 02:33.880
The logic is quite simple.

02:34.040 --> 02:44.030
If the size does not exist then we set the size to 200 and then if the email does not exist if the of

02:44.030 --> 02:48.540
the uses that exist then you want to return a default.

02:48.560 --> 02:56.090
You know he should keep the route which telling that Gravatar provides if the email does exist so if

02:56.100 --> 03:00.340
I want to make it less confusing so we want to do it for us.

03:01.840 --> 03:08.310
Good news here.

03:08.770 --> 03:10.850
Dan you want to hold this

03:13.660 --> 03:15.060
last confused

03:21.770 --> 03:22.960
else.

03:23.170 --> 03:31.180
If the e-mail does exist then you want to hash the password within the five encryption then you want

03:31.180 --> 03:36.600
to return the graveling together with the five encryption.

03:36.700 --> 03:42.830
So we have to call this function later on to really save the image to the database.

03:42.860 --> 03:49.260
I will show you guys how to do this Liron in this video we learn how to create another function that

03:49.260 --> 03:54.750
will generate an image by Gravatar Web site API in the next video.

03:54.840 --> 04:03.500
We will revise the entire schema and as well as exporting the entire schema out of file could use it.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.430
I'll see you guys in the next video.
