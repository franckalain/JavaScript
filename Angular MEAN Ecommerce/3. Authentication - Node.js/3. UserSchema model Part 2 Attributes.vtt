Hello guys will come back in the previous video we learn about why do we need users.

00:06.700 --> 00:14.730
Kiama in this video we will create a user schema and we will add all the important attributes.

00:14.760 --> 00:19.750
The first thing you need to do is you want to create a new folder and give it a name model so right

00:19.750 --> 00:29.850
clicking here and going to be modules this folder will hold all the models like user review and many

00:29.850 --> 00:30.900
more.

00:30.990 --> 00:37.130
Now you want to run it on a folder and you want to create a new file and you want you to use it or not.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.240
Yes.

00:39.720 --> 00:43.800
You need to import mongoose dependence and so on

00:46.540 --> 00:47.030
our

00:58.500 --> 01:04.030
schema is just an object so that you can create a user blueprint.

01:04.290 --> 01:07.750
So let us dice and into creating user schema.

01:08.100 --> 01:08.780
So it was good and

02:44.380 --> 02:49.010
these are the attributes that we need to have for each of our customer.

02:49.090 --> 02:52.520
First is email the e-mail of the user.

02:52.540 --> 02:58.140
It has to be unique and lowercase so it cannot be duplicated in the future.

02:58.150 --> 03:03.720
And the data type is a string Nexxus name name is Joe's.

03:03.730 --> 03:12.790
You know so that user can have a name and type is string Nexxus password same thing string picture string

03:13.450 --> 03:14.370
is.

03:14.740 --> 03:20.800
So when you want to sign up you have a choice to be Sellar or not the data type is a boolean true or

03:20.800 --> 03:21.980
force.

03:22.120 --> 03:29.350
And we put by default false because you know we one third that every user who signed up is not a seller

03:29.710 --> 03:36.220
because you have a choice to be a seller and then we have address Brister for address one address to

03:36.400 --> 03:39.810
all strings city state country postal code.

03:39.810 --> 03:47.980
Last thing is created data type is date because whenever a new user is created it will store the time

03:48.070 --> 03:50.160
when the users sign up.

03:50.170 --> 03:56.610
In this video we learn how to create our first schema which is user schema in the next video.

03:56.650 --> 04:00.270
We will learn how to encrypt a user password.

04:00.350 --> 04:02.270
I'll see you guys in the next video.
