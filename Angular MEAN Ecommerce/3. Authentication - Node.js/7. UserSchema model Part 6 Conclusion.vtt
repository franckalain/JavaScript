Hello guys will come back.

00:02.670 --> 00:11.160
So use your schema is just a blueprint and it will have a set of attributes and you can add more attributes

00:11.530 --> 00:13.460
as many as you like.

00:13.530 --> 00:21.690
For example if you want to go friend then you can type the data type will be type

00:24.430 --> 00:28.140
but of course we want to do this so we will actually remove

00:31.260 --> 00:38.520
the first function that we did is precinct's Mangu schema has this functionality as part of the object

00:39.150 --> 00:43.700
statically before we want to save the password attribute to the database.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.940
You want to encrypt the password attribute.

00:47.220 --> 00:57.830
So whenever we use the fast with is ABC entry tree it will get encrypted to just kind of hash value.

00:58.440 --> 00:59.850
So this again

01:03.890 --> 01:08.750
the second function that we created is a custom function.

01:08.750 --> 01:11.530
So technically we get every name comparer password.

01:11.720 --> 01:18.800
What it does is it compare password between the password and the user typed in and the password in the

01:18.800 --> 01:19.790
database.

01:19.790 --> 01:29.700
Simple that the file custom function that we learn is Gravatar the function will directly generate an

01:29.850 --> 01:31.440
image for us.

01:31.440 --> 01:44.780
Every time a user signs up it all thanks to Gravatar felting that we need to do is one to fix or this

01:44.930 --> 01:47.580
entire schema to do so.

01:48.420 --> 01:51.780
Model Daut export equals to mongoose model.

01:52.290 --> 01:55.450
And then the name of the model which will be user.

01:55.670 --> 02:01.740
And then this Monday you want to pass now in the file.

02:01.980 --> 02:11.180
You can simply do cons user or user close to this

02:15.890 --> 02:17.190
in the next view.

02:17.600 --> 02:22.730
We will learn how to create a sign up API or CEOs in next video.
