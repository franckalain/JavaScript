00:00.520 --> 00:05.450
In this video we will learn how to create a custom function only user schema.

00:05.550 --> 00:08.220
They will do the password comparing.

00:08.370 --> 00:15.960
So to take a look at here the objective in this video is to compare the password you enter with a password

00:16.140 --> 00:20.100
in the database to see whether they are match or not.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.680
So what are you waiting for.

00:21.720 --> 00:28.710
Let's go and dive in to go back to our used to do and right below here.

00:28.990 --> 00:31.640
Topping our

01:00.640 --> 01:08.950
to create a custom function you have to add methods than any member of your choice by group has a function

01:08.950 --> 01:11.590
called comparison technical way.

01:11.590 --> 01:20.680
Does it compare between a password that you type in with a password that has been encrypted in the database.

01:20.890 --> 01:26.970
So technically will pass in the password that you type in and the password in the database.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.100
That's it.

01:28.450 --> 01:35.080
In this video we learn how to create a custom function which is to compare password that the user types

01:35.080 --> 01:42.490
in and in the database in the next video we will create another custom function that will generate a

01:42.490 --> 01:46.200
custom image every time a user sign up.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.600
I'll see you guys in the next video.
