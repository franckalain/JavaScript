Noted the profound interest piaffe been done it's time to implement them.

00:05.100 --> 00:11.550
It is sad or angry application in this video to learn how to fetch information for each user.

00:11.710 --> 00:50.100
Let's start by opening up or text editor and opening up their service.

00:50.220 --> 00:58.970
Here is create a get profile method which will fetch the profile information for user in such here.

00:59.280 --> 01:04.620
We will check if the users are locked in and as a token start on the browser.

01:04.840 --> 01:13.840
If the token is stolen browser the app will get the user's profile using the link or here then the users

There are serious if an error occurs error will be displayed.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.780
Now let's open our app component

01:33.610 --> 01:38.870
inside the constructor code to get Prometa which will get to use this profile.

01:39.070 --> 01:46.810
When the user first uses our app also in the lock on meant that we will clear a user object every time

01:46.810 --> 01:48.610
the user locks out from our app.

01:49.060 --> 01:51.750
Now let's open up our registration component

01:57.080 --> 01:57.890

02:14.830 --> 02:17.610
When a user has been successfully locked in.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.410

02:38.190 --> 02:41.880

In this we deal have set up to get Prometa which fetches the profile information for users.

02:48.090 --> 02:51.020
