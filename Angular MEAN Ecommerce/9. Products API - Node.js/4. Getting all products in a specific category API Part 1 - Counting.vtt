Hello guys will come back.

00:02.170 --> 00:10.700
So what can we do now is I'm going to remove this coat completely I'm going to start from scratch.

00:11.050 --> 00:19.510
So the next thing I want to do is you want to type in a conference page to a class where he does.

00:19.900 --> 00:27.110
So again if someone requesting the page then it will just be equivalent to tree.

00:27.260 --> 00:34.530
Page will always be given to for example the number from the or else L for example the numbers like

00:34.530 --> 00:36.450
this.

00:36.450 --> 00:41.080
This was Bache possibly Dan Bache will be called tree

00:44.700 --> 00:48.660
and so we want to type in the same waterfall

00:51.160 --> 00:58.950
and then we want to function to this function.

00:58.960 --> 01:05.920
And then instead of doing something like this we want to put this in this one instead.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.190
So back

01:16.160 --> 01:26.510
to us.

01:45.500 --> 01:53.300
So the first missing functions object is to get the total amount of products that belong to this specific

01:53.300 --> 01:54.200
category.

01:54.590 --> 02:00.890
In our case for example books get angry and then you know we are using technically mongoose operation

02:00.890 --> 02:08.030
called Count to count all the products in the product collection that has this specific category that

02:09.020 --> 02:17.990
we use requests the parents ID to capture the parameter values from the R L which is just one then we

02:17.990 --> 02:24.200
pass in a callback with a parameters of error and the result of the query which is counted.

02:24.690 --> 02:31.100
Then we set down to a newly created variable called Total products.

02:31.110 --> 02:40.330
Finally if you want to trigger the next function saying we do callback when we pass in error or no.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.450
And the variable that you want to pass in.

02:44.370 --> 02:49.770
So simple as that in the next video we will continue on with the second scene.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.420
I'll see you guys in the next few.
