00:00.550 --> 00:08.440
So now let's go and do our second sink function function remember to add a comma or else you would get

00:08.440 --> 00:11.480
error because we are in that clean area.

00:12.400 --> 01:28.740
Bruce is.

01:28.910 --> 01:35.270
So the second is seeing functions objectives define all the products under this specific category they

01:35.270 --> 01:45.720
belong to this idea but we want to limited only to 10 products but API call so does skip is we then

01:45.860 --> 01:49.970
what we're doing is we are skipping how many products in general.

01:50.270 --> 01:59.700
So for example let's see the per page equals 10 and then page equivalent to that's true.

01:59.810 --> 02:01.780
For example all of this.

02:02.280 --> 02:11.970
Then technically what we're doing is three times ten times three so ten times three of them to 30 right.

02:12.360 --> 02:22.050
So whenever ten times three because it will skip actually 20 products and it's kind of confusing because

02:22.860 --> 02:32.500
in computer science we start you know indexes start from 0 1 2 and 3.

02:32.730 --> 02:35.550
So 30 is actually at 2.

02:35.880 --> 02:46.590
So we are actually skipping 20 products so the list goes on for we'll skip 40 but actually we skip dairy

02:46.590 --> 02:47.670
products.

02:48.090 --> 02:49.700
So on and so forth.

02:50.190 --> 02:59.210
So we move this so we just it is just we are skipping how many products and then leaving is you know

02:59.210 --> 03:02.330
we limit we want to limit how many products that we want to show.

03:02.760 --> 03:11.470
So per page we just want to show 10 products for each where he finally then we populate category and

03:11.530 --> 03:12.700
owner.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.320
So next is exact.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.050
Once we get the products we be.

03:18.170 --> 03:21.650
So we want to pass in next function.

03:21.850 --> 03:28.540
So we put two variables in the callbacks which is which are products and total products you must put

03:28.740 --> 03:34.230
error first or now before these two variables in the next video.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.020
We will continue on with the final scene.

03:37.090 --> 03:38.390
I'll see you guys in the next few.
