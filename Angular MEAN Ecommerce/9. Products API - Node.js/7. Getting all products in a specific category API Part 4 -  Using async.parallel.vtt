Interviews video we came to realize Zeeshan that we don't even need a waterfall at all.

00:07.970 --> 00:12.090
Each of the function is independent of one another.

00:12.320 --> 00:18.630
We only use a single waterfall if the next function is dependent on the previous functions variable.

00:18.650 --> 00:24.890
So instead of using waterfall we are using parallel because we want to run all the mongoose operations

00:25.310 --> 00:26.630
at the same time.

00:26.630 --> 00:27.590
So let's change the code

00:31.140 --> 00:36.030
to change just two parallel and then correct.

00:36.520 --> 00:45.130
And then we want to remove 2 to 1 to move this because it's independent.

00:45.240 --> 00:55.650
So we went through this and it was just two and we're going to cut this step.

00:55.660 --> 01:03.400
We're going to call back and damn we'll do it again.

01:06.670 --> 01:14.150
Here is the final function do you create all this

01:18.950 --> 01:26.630
or close to zero.

01:26.630 --> 01:26.900
Why.

01:26.950 --> 01:37.710
Because the index is Airey it is considered as zero technically 0 1 2.

01:38.090 --> 01:40.750
So index 0 in X-1 index too.

01:41.090 --> 01:44.640
So he has to forward this in zero.

01:44.660 --> 01:48.460
And we have to put all products equal and the result is zero.

01:49.160 --> 01:55.800
So I guess for this one it will be more result.

01:56.700 --> 02:01.650
So the bar product includes the results.

02:01.880 --> 02:10.220
One last the bar category will be resolved too.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.180
And then we push this here

02:18.110 --> 02:19.400
category.

02:19.460 --> 02:21.730
All right.

02:21.910 --> 02:27.790
So let's go ahead and test it out again with if we have any problem and it shows a good post-wedding

02:29.530 --> 02:33.850
and check it here.

02:33.860 --> 02:36.420
Nothing at the center again.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.720
And there you have it.

02:39.980 --> 02:47.940
This is way better than before because right now each function is not dependent on the previous function.

02:47.960 --> 02:54.080
Now Iran separately and then we'll just you know in the final function it would just give the results

02:54.170 --> 02:58.520
in 0 1 and 2 index.

02:58.580 --> 03:03.000
In this video we change from a single waterfall to a scene.

03:03.290 --> 03:08.810
Parallel it in next video we will learn how to create a single product API.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.000
So I'll see you guys in the next VDU.
