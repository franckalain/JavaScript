00:00.600 --> 00:12.950
So is one function will finally sing and the products total products has to be disonance products into

00:12.990 --> 00:13.980
products.

00:14.550 --> 00:22.890
And finally just in case you want to call and not to sing functionally wrong timing is going to be three

00:23.220 --> 00:26.210
separate sink functions.

01:33.190 --> 01:37.710
The object is to get the category name that.

01:38.140 --> 01:45.600
But why we can get it from the previous to a seeings because the result is an area for example products

01:45.990 --> 01:46.960
in an area.

01:47.320 --> 01:52.990
So therefore we want to capture the product category name then we have to do for example

01:56.960 --> 02:04.570
zero which is something that is not you know good to do because it is super risky because what if there

02:04.570 --> 02:10.580
is no product under this category then products z index 0 will be no.

02:10.960 --> 02:15.830
This will run and that equerry just define the category name.

02:15.940 --> 02:24.740
So it is pretty easy for in here where finding a specific category find one with passing the parents

02:24.790 --> 02:34.340
and then we just respond with adjacent objects which products category name products and pages.

02:34.540 --> 02:35.910
Let's go and test it out.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.950
So let's go to postman.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.040
So was good too.

02:41.050 --> 02:42.150
Which one is it.

02:42.190 --> 02:43.470
This one.

02:43.980 --> 02:48.680
So go ahead and send there we have it.

02:48.700 --> 03:02.570
We have 10 products only category names cats to total products to and pages we have tree Awesome again

03:02.720 --> 03:07.010
seeing waterfall is just a function that depends on the previous function.

03:07.460 --> 03:14.990
But the funny thing is are these functions dependent on one another in the next video.

03:15.130 --> 03:22.300
We will run another missing function that run three separate query at the same time.

03:22.340 --> 03:24.140
I'll see you guys in the next video.
