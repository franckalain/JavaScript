00:00.670 --> 00:04.530
In this video we will learn how to create a single product.

00:04.770 --> 00:06.360
So let's dive in straight.

00:06.810 --> 00:10.740
So right here you want to tap in router and get

01:37.990 --> 01:38.830
this time.

01:38.830 --> 01:49.360
We are finding by the documents object ID instead of just find one it is we are using find by ID again

01:49.720 --> 01:53.790
we passed that requires that parents ID to search a single product.

01:53.980 --> 01:57.860
This mongs operation will only return a single product.

01:57.970 --> 01:59.800
It behaves this one.

01:59.830 --> 02:04.400
Exactly like find one would only be given the ID of the product.

02:04.690 --> 02:10.670
Then we populate two attributes category and owner.

02:10.690 --> 02:15.140
Finally if there is an error we show a message you no product.

02:15.250 --> 02:20.400
Not fun else we return the product object.

02:20.400 --> 02:24.660
Let us test it out and let's test it out on postman.

02:24.670 --> 02:40.280
So here you have those 30 to cross product of the product and then so this retreated from one of these

02:40.280 --> 02:41.250
products right.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.990
So it is good and get from these products.

02:47.230 --> 02:49.620
The King

02:52.710 --> 03:03.150
this is not this is not a this is one copy it here did get

03:06.440 --> 03:07.790
there you have it.

03:07.790 --> 03:16.460
Success in this video we learn how to use another mongoose operation which is the same as find one specifically

03:16.460 --> 03:24.050
for searching the object id of the product in the next video we will create a main product API that

03:24.050 --> 03:27.010
will behave the seen as categories ID.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.440
I'll see you guys in the next video.
