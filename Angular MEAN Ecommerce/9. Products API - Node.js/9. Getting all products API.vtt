00:00.620 --> 00:04.880
In this video we will create the main API for products.

00:04.990 --> 00:06.190
So go and do that.

00:06.580 --> 00:08.810
So you will behave exactly like categories.

00:08.950 --> 00:19.090
So I'm just going to copy this capitis and I'm going to go I'm going to do this and I'm going to paste

00:19.090 --> 00:25.480
it up here and I want to change this to just the products.

00:25.990 --> 00:28.120
So we're going to get you going to get all.

00:28.140 --> 00:34.450
I mean any any products writing products I'm going to read this and I'm going to remove this one

00:37.130 --> 00:39.480
remove category.

00:39.710 --> 00:46.320
It won't be any category name and I think that's spot on.

00:46.340 --> 00:47.180
All right.

00:47.220 --> 00:52.210
Will be no category right.

00:53.060 --> 00:54.800
You know I think that's about it.

00:54.870 --> 00:56.950
So go ahead and test this.

00:57.270 --> 01:05.040
So instead of giving a specific category we want to find you know all the products in the products you

01:05.040 --> 01:09.040
know documents or we call the collection to be more specific.

01:09.090 --> 01:10.260
So let's go ahead and do that.

01:10.260 --> 01:15.830
So it's good to Huisman when you go to those

01:18.230 --> 01:25.890
products get in and get all the products but only 10 items.

01:25.950 --> 01:30.110
So if you go scroll down to products 23.

01:30.530 --> 01:32.280
Awesome.

01:32.340 --> 01:40.050
So in the next section at comparison walking guys true on the angler and I'll see you guys in the next

01:40.380 --> 01:41.620
section.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.060
Stay hungry stay foolish.

01:44.190 --> 01:44.490
By.
