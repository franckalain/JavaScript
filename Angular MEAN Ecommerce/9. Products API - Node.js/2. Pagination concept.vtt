Hello guys pagination is technically limiting the amount of documents that we're going to get from the

00:06.670 --> 00:08.520
movie database.

00:08.550 --> 00:12.930
So imagine if we have 3000 products in the database.

00:13.260 --> 00:20.550
If you use product that's fine it will not be efficient because we are getting all the products from

00:20.670 --> 00:22.260
the database.

00:22.260 --> 00:26.010
Instead we want to return a specific set amount of products.

00:26.010 --> 00:30.480
For example 10 products per API called.

00:30.530 --> 00:38.870
So if they are treat us and products it will have 300 pages and we want to return 10 products on each

00:38.930 --> 00:40.440
API call.

00:40.460 --> 00:47.600
So in the next video we will learn how to implement the pagination to mongoose operation.

00:47.980 --> 00:50.080
I'll see you guys in the next video.
