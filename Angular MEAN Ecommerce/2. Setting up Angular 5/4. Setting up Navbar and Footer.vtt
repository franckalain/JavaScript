Hello dear fellow students in a previous We do have configured dependencies for angular application.

00:07.340 --> 00:10.440
This we deal with setting up our next bar and food.

00:10.800 --> 00:15.410
Let's start by opening whooshes studio code and opening up style.

00:15.480 --> 00:16.410
SPSS

00:39.230 --> 00:47.570
here will create a class that has a blue background color links and buttons that have a pointer cursor

00:48.630 --> 00:56.780
links that turn yellow when they are work and sections that have a minimum height of 600 pixels.

00:56.780 --> 01:00.470
Now let's open up component s SPSS

01:28.080 --> 01:28.610
here.

01:28.650 --> 01:35.090
If the StarLink or such button along with setting the width of our logo to 50 pixels.

01:35.110 --> 01:37.450
Now let's open up component

02:03.320 --> 02:03.800
here.

02:03.830 --> 02:12.710
If the two were both the class which are such term and is collapsed is collapsed wearable is used to

02:12.710 --> 02:21.270
determine if the mobo manual is ex-Penn it collapsed when at least in Mobile you also add a token getter.

02:21.380 --> 02:24.030
We should return our lock in token.

02:24.160 --> 02:28.730
This will be used later when we implement the authentication feature.

02:28.760 --> 02:36.190
The collapse function here is used to control with our mobile and menu it's collapsed crows drop down

02:36.190 --> 02:45.960
here is used to close our nav bar drop down lock out will be used later for the function and search.

02:45.960 --> 02:49.500
All here will be used later for the search function.

02:49.500 --> 02:53.050
Now let's open up a component here.

02:54.260 --> 03:01.260
The Neph BVD place on top of the router outlet and a footer to be placed below the route to Outlook.

03:01.330 --> 03:07.290
This is so that the nav bar and footer remain in the same place when the contents in the router has

03:07.290 --> 03:07.850
changed

03:43.980 --> 03:44.770
here.

03:44.860 --> 03:46.170
Create a nav bar.

03:46.200 --> 03:54.870
If the class nav bar nav bar expand the taskbar and B.G. main This means that a nav bar would change

03:54.870 --> 04:01.590
the mobile wheel when the screen size is small to medium text inside it will be gray and the background

04:01.590 --> 04:05.360
in Deathbird be a blue color inside it.

04:05.400 --> 04:12.070
I've created the fluid container it would take up the full width of the screen inside it created an

04:12.070 --> 04:16.460
image link to redirect to the homepage when it is clicked.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.330
You also have a button below it.

04:18.510 --> 04:21.160
We should talk go to Mobot menu when it is clicked.
