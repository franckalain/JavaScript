Hey guys Zahm Peterson here.

00:02.870 --> 00:08.180
In a previous video we've talked about and get a router how we can use it to change the content of our

00:08.180 --> 00:08.700
app.

00:08.810 --> 00:14.080
According to the route that the users currently own and with also create the home component in this

00:14.120 --> 00:20.600
we are going to add image charism to our home component before we create our image carousel.

00:20.780 --> 00:23.400
You must first acquire the images required.

00:23.900 --> 00:27.010
Let's start by going to Amazon Dot com.

00:30.960 --> 00:35.160
And then you download the images here.

00:39.870 --> 00:40.900
D-Mich. one

00:43.990 --> 00:45.390
image to

00:51.030 --> 00:51.470
actually

00:55.090 --> 01:01.310
which for an image file.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.960
Now this is done ready to set up.

01:05.000 --> 01:18.960
Or better that's opened up a text editor and open home component T.M. let's create a section here and

01:18.970 --> 01:23.320
I hope it will create a container

01:34.600 --> 01:38.730
here we've created the section and inside it we've created a diff.

01:38.860 --> 01:41.870
It will only be shown when a screen size is larger than medium

01:52.490 --> 02:01.680
to NGV carrousel text is to charism itself and then Engy template and Bistline is the better image.

02:12.880 --> 02:19.330
The engine template is copy and paste for more times and each of them will be linked to a different

02:19.330 --> 02:20.800
better image.

02:20.800 --> 02:28.120
Now let's take a look at our app so we can see that the banner images are showing up but they are not

02:28.120 --> 02:29.940
behaving like they should.

02:29.940 --> 02:31.780
Let's minimize this.

02:31.840 --> 02:35.360
Now let's open up some component Yes SPSS

02:52.230 --> 02:54.320
that's minimizer or text editor.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.410
Open up a browser.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.900
Now we can see the banner is centered correctly in this we deal with edit an image carries out to our

03:03.900 --> 03:09.330
home page and the next we do we create a resource that is use for API called.
