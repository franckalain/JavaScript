Hey guys.

00:01.140 --> 00:06.600
My name is Ellen Peterson and I've been working as a full set with a developer for four years in this

00:06.600 --> 00:09.670
course I've been teaching guys how to create the front end.

00:09.790 --> 00:16.410
They will be used for a course in the last section of dependencies that are required for a server in

00:16.410 --> 00:20.460
this section regarding to set up the dependencies for front end as well.

00:20.850 --> 00:23.610
But before we get to that that's a look at the app.

00:23.670 --> 00:25.560
There are going to be doing this course.

00:25.710 --> 00:40.210
So let's open up our app.

00:40.300 --> 00:47.670
So this is the home schema of our app which has an image charism I'm cartes.

00:47.790 --> 01:07.260
We also have a registration page and a looking page Solway them all when I sign in.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.830
So this is the profile page.

01:10.010 --> 01:16.610
From here we can go to our oldest page change our account settings and change our souping address.

01:16.790 --> 01:23.360
And if you register as a seller we can also post a product for sale as well as all the products that

01:23.360 --> 01:24.180
we've posted.

01:25.820 --> 01:27.720
Let's go to the features of my 1

01:32.580 --> 01:33.710
Aura's page.

01:33.730 --> 01:41.210
We can see the orders they have made the total of each order and a status of each order in the site.

01:43.580 --> 01:45.830
We can see the products in each order

01:49.060 --> 02:00.450
in a card setting page of our name email center status as soon as our password change shipping address

02:00.450 --> 02:10.870
page we can change our shipping address and our seller we can access the post put up for sale page which

02:10.870 --> 02:13.860
allows us to post support of our choosing for sale.

02:14.780 --> 02:23.220
So I see the products that posted our e-commerce store also has a category's page which allows us to

02:23.220 --> 02:28.990
start products by category as well as at new category store stores if deemed necessary.

02:29.840 --> 02:37.040
And here again to see the products that are inside the cat category helmet and head ergonomic metal

02:37.040 --> 02:47.010
chicken as well as ergonomic concrete you also have a search page which allows us to search paradoxes

02:47.030 --> 02:56.350
our e-commerce store and here it includes the proto name to sell off a product the price or a rating

02:57.810 --> 02:58.630

03:13.330 --> 03:20.460

03:20.860 --> 03:22.180
To purchase a product.

03:22.190 --> 03:28.960
You can just add it to a cart and then here to say Spurlock successfully the cart when it's time to

03:28.960 --> 03:35.470
check out the owner's head under the cart page where we can see everything that is in our car and increase

03:35.470 --> 03:37.120
the quality of our products.

03:38.690 --> 03:45.270
We were satisfied with the products in our cart and simply press the checkout button and enter our email

03:50.170 --> 03:50.640

03:55.350 --> 03:56.730

04:12.840 --> 04:19.600
