00:02.680 --> 00:08.140
They've taken a look at the features that are e-commerce application has in this video we are installing

00:08.130 --> 00:11.070
the dependencies they're required for angular.

00:11.070 --> 00:18.780
Let's start by opening up our Amazonas folder on that stuff and then create a new folder called Client

00:20.450 --> 00:21.540
inside here.

00:21.600 --> 00:29.750
Open up the partial window and type in and install that builder.

00:30.350 --> 00:32.830
Enter angular s.l.

00:32.830 --> 00:44.480

00:45.010 --> 00:47.330
dash dash style cost.

00:47.420 --> 00:54.320
Yes as this allows us to create a new app if the name and Amazonas.

00:54.730 --> 01:04.860
If rolling pre-configured and app styling using s.c.s s Now let's change directory to our app and then

01:04.920 --> 01:07.470
type in and install

01:10.400 --> 01:26.000
and bootstrap selection and wrap.

01:26.010 --> 01:28.530
Now that's open that we show studio code

01:31.320 --> 01:37.050
then we direct our Amazonas folder inside.

01:37.060 --> 01:38.810
Now let's open our browser

01:42.620 --> 01:44.100
such as strep for

01:49.980 --> 01:51.130
search for fun.

01:51.140 --> 01:53.860

01:56.760 --> 02:03.400
took the first thing here copy the link here.

02:04.610 --> 02:14.700
The original code client and Mizuno source next to your mail.

02:14.910 --> 02:17.900
We don't hear the pace in the link

03:04.150 --> 03:05.180
here.

03:05.220 --> 03:11.650
We've added the bootstrap for C S S phone or some 4.7 to C S S and our icon.

03:12.120 --> 03:17.270
The link for the icon can be found in the lecturer's notes in this video.

03:17.310 --> 03:22.600
You've successfully set up the required dependencies in and that's when you will be declaring that it

03:22.590 --> 03:26.330
is totally painless in the app so that dependencies can be used.
