WEBVTT

01:03.310 --> 01:10.690
So this is the container that contains our links and such bar should expand and collapse according to

01:10.690 --> 01:13.860
the collapse wearable inside it.

01:13.870 --> 01:20.560
We are funding the container with the class of input group and a width of seventy five percent.

01:20.670 --> 01:30.310
Inside the container we have a lot of text input which well-you is bound to do Webo search term below

01:30.310 --> 01:31.850
that text input.

01:31.930 --> 01:36.080
It's a span which acts as the search button.

01:36.450 --> 01:42.470
The user can search either by hitting enter or clicking the spell itself.

01:42.700 --> 01:43.210
Moving on

02:14.070 --> 02:17.640
below the search is in the RV.

02:17.850 --> 02:26.800
It takes up the full weight of containing the if this def contains links that are useful navigation.

02:26.860 --> 02:34.260
The next item over here will change the route that the U.S. is currently on and also collapse the mobile

02:34.260 --> 02:35.020
menu.

02:35.200 --> 03:01.820
But it is quick.

03:02.030 --> 03:08.320
Now we've created an item in an ordered list it shows a drop down when it is clicked.

03:08.420 --> 03:14.730
This item will be positioned to run most of the screen when the screen size is larger than medium.

03:14.810 --> 03:22.100
The list item contains a link which toggles the drop down when clicked the link will show the text accounts

03:22.990 --> 03:24.470
when no user is signed in

04:41.490 --> 04:46.190
to dropdown link is the actual dropdown itself.

04:46.510 --> 04:53.100
Items is drop down the collapse the drop down and collapse the Mohamedi as well.

04:53.570 --> 05:00.630
The profile and lockout page will only be visible when the user is not locked in at the drop down item

05:01.500 --> 05:09.220
is a regularly Adam should collapse the mobo menu but it is clicked after the router.

05:09.740 --> 05:11.160
We create our folder

05:52.070 --> 06:03.110
Fouda here has an idea of mine for also has a green color of dark blue and has a copyright text centered

06:03.140 --> 06:04.720
inside.

06:04.830 --> 06:12.030
In this we do set up the neph bar in the future for angular app and unless we do we set it up and get

06:12.030 --> 06:16.770
a router that changes the page displayed according to the user is currently on.
