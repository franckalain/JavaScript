Hello guys the last we do have sort of left behind flitter for our pages in this we do.

00:07.570 --> 00:09.870
We take a look at and get a router.

00:10.070 --> 00:19.590
Let's start by opening up a partial window and then typing in kanji generate from Poland.

00:22.430 --> 00:30.370
Once this is done that's type in anti-circ and minimize the window.

00:30.370 --> 00:39.540
Now let's open up our text editor at routing more you to at rolling Mungiu is in charge of determining

00:39.870 --> 00:42.940
what component should be displayed when a certain route is.

01:00.470 --> 01:02.100
In the rotary.

01:02.160 --> 01:06.240
We've created two objects in the first object.

01:06.350 --> 01:12.120
We've declared path for an empty string and a component of some component.

01:12.140 --> 01:18.440
This means when you visit the path of an empty string we'll be direct to the home component in a second

01:18.440 --> 01:24.490
object with a puff of double Asterix and a redirect property of empty string.

01:24.500 --> 01:30.580
This means when the part of the reason you start in the rotary we will be redirected to home component.

01:30.890 --> 01:35.480
Now let's go to our browser and open up our app.

01:36.860 --> 01:43.190
And here you can see that are at least working and homework's is despicable here.

01:43.630 --> 01:50.360
If you try to go to another route for example profile which does not exist yet will be redirected to

01:50.360 --> 01:51.480
the home route.

01:53.150 --> 01:54.490
Now tethered a router is set up.

01:54.620 --> 02:00.080
We can change the component as displayed depending on the route in the next video be setting up the

02:00.080 --> 02:01.770
home page which will continue.

02:01.820 --> 02:02.390
Much charism.
