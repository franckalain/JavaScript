00:00.570 --> 00:02.060
Hello guys will come back.

00:02.070 --> 00:05.000
Amazon Web Services is an amazing service.

00:05.190 --> 00:12.200
It has many things that we could use like hosting a server using machine learning API and so on.

00:12.330 --> 00:17.780
In order for us to store the image we need an Amazon Web Services account.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.200
We're going to store it on our street.

00:20.250 --> 00:22.120
So let's go ahead and do just that.

00:22.160 --> 00:32.350
Go to Amazon Web Services website Amazon services and you want to click the second link and you want

00:32.350 --> 00:36.040
to sign up first for me already sign up so I'm going to sign in.

00:36.340 --> 00:43.710
So one sign then you want to click as tree and you want to create a new bucket and you want to give

00:43.710 --> 00:49.200
it a name zone on a web application.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.910
That's next.

00:50.910 --> 00:59.020
Next next the next thing you want to do is you want to go to services and you want to go down and under

00:59.020 --> 01:01.110
secret identity and compliance.

01:01.290 --> 01:08.380
You want to right click here hop on the link and cutup and you want to click users and you want to add

01:08.720 --> 01:09.790
your user.

01:09.790 --> 01:19.340
So I'm going to give it a name or ushe or programatic ex-US it will pass custom password

01:22.710 --> 01:35.060
and next permission and then I'm just going to click this as tree.

01:35.130 --> 01:37.010
I mean this one.

01:37.010 --> 01:40.700
And then next review create user

01:43.540 --> 01:44.480
and that's about it.

01:44.480 --> 01:49.370
So you want to copy this and this or you can actually download to see if you file.

01:49.460 --> 01:57.690
You can download the credentials or you can actually copy this and you can actually pieces somewhere.

01:57.770 --> 02:02.470
So you do want to close the step just because you need access DNC access.

02:02.780 --> 02:03.860
So live it.

02:04.070 --> 02:09.710
So good to see management console type and you want to go to Amazon Amazon web petition.

02:09.710 --> 02:12.660
So currently it is not public.

02:12.710 --> 02:16.550
We want to change it to public just like Amazon or version 1.

02:16.580 --> 02:22.490
So in order for us to do that you know this and you want to go to permission bucket policy and you're

02:22.490 --> 02:23.970
going to do something here.

02:23.990 --> 02:30.890
So in order for us to generate market policy you want to go to a new tab and type in bucket all those

02:31.090 --> 02:36.020
we generate to and then you went to the first slaying.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.440
So make sure you're on the speech.

02:38.450 --> 02:45.570
So just to eschew bucket policy principle with asterisks and then all action.

02:45.770 --> 02:51.540
And if you and you've got to go back to you manage your console and you want to copy this entire thing.

02:52.090 --> 02:58.800
Copy it here paste it and you want to add this asterisk.

02:58.810 --> 02:59.160
Right.

02:59.180 --> 03:07.690
Remember it's the same like this as stateman generate policy and copy this entire thing and you want

03:07.690 --> 03:09.840
to go back to S-G management console.

03:10.080 --> 03:10.900
Even a PC here

03:14.010 --> 03:15.350
Whoops.

03:15.450 --> 03:16.140
Correct right.

03:16.180 --> 03:17.810
Yes it is.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.290
See it.

03:19.470 --> 03:22.470
And this bucket has public access.

03:22.470 --> 03:29.210
So awesome in this video we learn how to create S3 bucket and make it public in the next video.

03:29.250 --> 03:33.850
We will install all the necessary dependencies to upload an image d'esprit.

03:33.900 --> 03:36.240
I'll see you guys in the next video.
