00:00.760 --> 00:03.280
In this video we will create an upload function.

00:03.280 --> 00:06.410
This function is a means to communicate directly to St..

00:06.470 --> 00:13.640
So we store the images directly to us tree with the help of mulcher and mulcher as tree.

00:13.870 --> 00:15.130
Let's dive in.

00:15.130 --> 00:32.060
So underneath here you function call up those water and dense storage still reach the motor tree

00:36.020 --> 00:42.580
and then the next thing is history will be destroyed or damaged.

00:42.790 --> 00:45.930
I don't know I don't know what

00:49.110 --> 00:50.060
the name of a bucket.

00:50.070 --> 00:58.620
If you don't know go back here with this street and check the name of your bucket we're going to be

00:58.840 --> 01:05.730
on a web application somebody will back to my views to you and I'm with you here where I left off so

01:05.830 --> 01:14.790
that data on she was even.

01:15.320 --> 01:23.030
No.

01:32.090 --> 01:34.570
So he will be just seems obvious.

01:34.600 --> 01:35.590
Copy this.

01:35.630 --> 01:37.620
This is huge changes

01:42.030 --> 01:42.370
it

01:49.410 --> 01:52.460
when you see this.

01:52.520 --> 01:56.350
So technically you are creating a storage.

01:56.630 --> 02:03.620
And the attributes that you need to set are as tree which we take from the variable above which is this

02:03.620 --> 02:12.070
one the bucket name which is Amazo percussion meant data which is the information relates to the file.

02:12.110 --> 02:16.480
And finally C is the name of the uploaded file.

02:16.970 --> 02:23.320
So in this video we learned on how to create an upload function in the next video.

02:23.320 --> 02:27.980
We will learn how to create a product API that is a post method.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.220
I'll see you guys in the next video.
