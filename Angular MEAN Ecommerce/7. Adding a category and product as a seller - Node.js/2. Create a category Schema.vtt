Hello guys will come back.

00:02.040 --> 00:09.270
We need to create a category schema so that we could have categories like baby cats dogs books and many

00:09.270 --> 00:10.050
more.

00:10.290 --> 00:15.600
In this video we will quit our second schema which will be category schema.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.050
Let's go ahead and create a new file and give it a name Karoubi.

00:19.140 --> 01:35.650
Yes all server models right click and during s let's impart something important dependencies.

01:35.740 --> 01:37.090
It is pretty straightforward.

01:37.090 --> 01:43.830
We create a category schema and then we give it we give two attributes name and created her name.

01:43.850 --> 01:45.260
That data type is green.

01:45.280 --> 01:51.880
And he has to be unique and Loki's has to be true to avoid duplication and then time Krischan whenever

01:51.970 --> 01:54.850
a new category has been created.

01:54.850 --> 01:59.950
And then finally we export this entire schema the given name category and we pass passing the category

01:59.950 --> 02:02.050
schema object.

02:02.180 --> 02:08.030
In this video we created our second schema which is category schema in the next video.

02:08.180 --> 02:11.060
Create and add a new category API.

02:11.060 --> 02:12.670
So I'll see just in the next few.
