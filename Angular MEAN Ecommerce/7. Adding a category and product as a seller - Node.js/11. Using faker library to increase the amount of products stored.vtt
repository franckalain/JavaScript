Hello Gus will come back.

00:01.850 --> 00:08.610
Sometimes we need to add as many products as possible so that we can search a product at magination

00:09.000 --> 00:10.130
and many more.

00:10.500 --> 00:14.880
Adding an item one by one is just not that efficient to test.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.630
So the first thing we want to do is you want to go to your house show and cancel server and you want

00:22.630 --> 00:24.310
to store a live record.

00:24.400 --> 00:35.700
So the power dash dash so we don't always think to add to your studio and up here we want to do is you

00:35.700 --> 00:42.440
want to add conses thicker the quarter figure.

00:42.920 --> 00:43.820
Right.

00:44.220 --> 00:53.900
So if you're just put in a comment join us for that.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.570
So always go ahead and write code.

00:55.970 --> 01:01.330
So faker is actually to generate as many feet as possible.

01:01.620 --> 01:02.860
So you'll see an action.

01:02.910 --> 01:03.140
Sure.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.240
Yes.

01:48.030 --> 02:00.570
So I use it you type in dot image tags if you want more detail you can go to Chrome securly javascript.

02:01.110 --> 02:08.070
Your first one and it can take a look at the attributes and it feels that they provide zip code address

02:08.100 --> 02:10.520
combers company and so on.

02:10.870 --> 02:17.440
So we go back to use to doing Contini will last us says this

02:26.530 --> 02:27.970
was prior

02:32.680 --> 02:35.380
to some

02:39.580 --> 02:48.590
sort of price race.

02:48.670 --> 02:51.190
And finally you want to be

02:58.260 --> 03:02.810
Selassie you want to add press on

03:06.310 --> 03:06.500
so

03:10.350 --> 03:15.480
many issues.

03:16.020 --> 03:16.370
All right.

03:16.410 --> 03:22.210
So before that we want to put owner and we want to put request step parents Zackary.

03:22.470 --> 03:30.790
So we've got to do that because we need to get it from you know for postman pedigree because to this.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.660
So first let's go to postman and let's take a look at categories.

03:34.860 --> 03:42.920
Let's go ahead and grab cats on campus get ready to put your.

03:44.840 --> 03:54.990
And then as for owner we want to go to our ushe our issues here so we can find out.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.660
It's good to hear.

03:59.580 --> 04:00.210
Zone or

04:03.930 --> 04:05.050
a uses I create it.

04:05.050 --> 04:10.960
So it's good to want to be users and it's good to OROSZ Irish Coffee is a

04:14.060 --> 04:14.950
cockpit.

04:15.080 --> 04:22.330
Let's go back to new studio and pasted right here.

04:22.330 --> 04:25.690
See it and let's go ahead and test this route.

04:25.830 --> 04:26.220
Just say

04:31.590 --> 04:35.490
this one you should put it is don't we don't need this idea.

04:35.490 --> 04:37.220
All right.

04:37.590 --> 04:38.560
See this.

04:38.610 --> 04:45.350
Let's go back to Boseman groove people.

04:45.750 --> 04:50.780
What is the name of the curve.

04:51.210 --> 04:54.260
That's right.

04:56.590 --> 04:56.930
OK.

04:56.970 --> 04:58.870
We haven't actually started to

05:05.050 --> 05:12.300
connected to the database so you can send it isn't that.

05:12.520 --> 05:21.520
Salir that solar send successfully added 20 pictures.

05:21.770 --> 05:27.390
So you want to go to sell this product which is this just this one.

05:27.440 --> 05:34.340
Right now there's only one item which is how low and description I mean the titles mean that the products

05:34.370 --> 05:34.760
only.

05:34.850 --> 05:35.680
Hello.

05:36.140 --> 05:38.180
So let's go in and click send.

05:38.890 --> 05:44.830
And now we have 20 products you can see as image intelligent drug or mouse.

05:44.860 --> 05:46.390
Image is this.

05:46.570 --> 05:51.160
And then you get another product call rustic metal bands.

05:51.170 --> 05:57.770
I know kind of weird name but certainly faker is a library or a dependency to actually generate as many

05:57.770 --> 06:01.130
products as you want if you want to test it out.

06:01.220 --> 06:07.060
So in this section we learn how to post an image to a street.

06:07.320 --> 06:12.740
So in the next section Adam Peterson will what is true on the front and back.

06:13.050 --> 06:16.140
So I'll see you guys in the next couple of sections by.
