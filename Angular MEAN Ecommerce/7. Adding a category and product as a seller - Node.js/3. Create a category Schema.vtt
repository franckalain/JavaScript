Hello guy she will come back in this video which will create a new category API.

00:05.690 --> 00:06.670
Let's dive in.

00:06.950 --> 00:11.550
So the first thing you want to do is you want to create a new file under routes and you want to give

00:11.550 --> 00:13.220
your name mean.

00:13.370 --> 00:14.420
Yes.

00:14.510 --> 00:19.210
This file will hold all the category and product we later to you or else.

00:19.250 --> 00:23.090
So the first thing we need to do is we need to import two libraries.

00:23.090 --> 00:29.750
One is library that we just install which is express and the other one is the local library which is

00:29.810 --> 00:32.210
our model category schema.

00:32.300 --> 00:35.240
So you go and do that conc or

00:54.550 --> 00:58.540
so we have to change you made a typo category.

00:58.800 --> 00:59.240
OK.

00:59.380 --> 01:01.240
Now one is the router.

01:01.630 --> 01:06.020
You know route and then the name will be categories.

01:06.230 --> 01:11.590
Then we'll have to training method which will be get and pose.

01:11.650 --> 01:16.210
So we're going to focus on the post first because we want to add and you get to first.

01:16.430 --> 01:23.940
So go good and that was response and next here you want a new kitty.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.360
Do to get.

01:28.900 --> 01:43.120
And then category name we go through the DOT territory and then get a green dot safe that opens on keys

01:43.280 --> 01:46.170
and success

01:50.230 --> 01:57.760
message.

01:58.840 --> 02:04.680
So now what we want to do is you want to make or model in the router.

02:04.690 --> 02:05.450
Sorry.

02:05.680 --> 02:14.990
Save this file and you want it to serve us and you want to copy this thing and paste it here and she's

02:15.040 --> 02:15.730
used to

02:19.330 --> 02:19.960
this

02:27.100 --> 02:40.470
I mean oh I mean it's going to be like this is here and here.

02:42.310 --> 02:43.400
So we go back to mean no.

02:43.420 --> 02:44.290
Yes.

02:44.290 --> 02:45.900
You know what is happening.

02:46.030 --> 02:52.760
We create a new category object and we store you know the name of it by the requested body got category.

02:52.990 --> 02:59.080
And then we saved the category and we responds with two objects just an object which is success and

02:59.080 --> 02:59.780
message.

03:00.040 --> 03:05.160
And finally we just you know export the router so that we could use it on the server.

03:05.170 --> 03:07.200
So now let's go ahead and test it out.

03:07.220 --> 03:13.870
Google Chrome this postman.

03:14.010 --> 03:15.920
Let's go ahead and test it out.

03:15.990 --> 03:16.950
Loading loading.

03:16.990 --> 03:17.740
Right.

03:17.850 --> 03:27.770
So this opened up a new tab and localhost to the API and it's

03:33.230 --> 03:36.220
body will have a name.

03:36.860 --> 03:38.280
And let's give it a shot.

03:38.360 --> 03:42.380
Let's give it a name folks.

03:42.500 --> 03:48.450
And now what we need to do first is we need to run the pulse Shelfer so exclusive stuff.

03:49.530 --> 03:52.680
Could shift right quick shift for a week.

03:53.530 --> 03:56.980
Open boat show the Amazon

04:00.090 --> 04:09.320
server and then no server magic happens from port to the tree and connects to the database go back to

04:09.320 --> 04:14.640
postman and let's go ahead and send true message.

04:14.870 --> 04:19.460
So we have successfully created a new category API.

04:19.460 --> 04:23.780
So in this video we learn how to post a new category in the next video.

04:23.870 --> 04:26.090
We will learn how to get all the categories.

04:26.180 --> 04:28.230
So I'll see you guys in the next video.
