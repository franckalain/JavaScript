Hello guys you will come back.

00:02.020 --> 00:05.720
It is video we will learn how to sell those products.

00:05.740 --> 00:07.500
So what we hear.

00:07.620 --> 00:13.160
I actually added rest Jaison for testing purposes so you can read it because we are going to change

00:13.160 --> 00:14.690
it to something else.

00:15.250 --> 00:20.570
So the first thing you want to do is you want to add chalk did ot right.

00:20.580 --> 00:21.840
That's a first step.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.640
And now we want to do is you want to do product

00:27.180 --> 00:33.280
line on both requests code it.

00:33.730 --> 00:35.170
These are great

00:40.300 --> 00:42.200
products.

00:43.090 --> 00:44.110
OK.

00:44.200 --> 00:44.490
All right.

00:44.500 --> 00:52.330
That's not to happen because we're going to to the owner and category.

00:52.750 --> 00:53.870
So probably

00:59.070 --> 01:13.870
Papalia again category and then all we run exact.

01:13.910 --> 01:21.950
So in here you want to do products then want to respond within just an object.

01:22.340 --> 01:27.130
Access true massive

01:29.290 --> 01:39.500
products and products products.

01:39.570 --> 01:41.220
All right cool.

01:42.100 --> 01:49.060
So what is going on here is we are finding all the products that belong to this owner so it belongs

01:49.060 --> 01:54.800
to us stand it will be belongs to artists we want to find all products that belong to our.

01:55.180 --> 02:00.360
And the next thing you want to do is we want to populate owner and category.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.030
I know you guys must be wondering what is popular.

02:03.040 --> 02:03.660
Right.

02:03.990 --> 02:07.210
So in a nutshell population is like this.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.150
For example a frog.

02:09.670 --> 02:12.590
And then you have an owner.

02:12.820 --> 02:15.610
I see the idea.

02:15.640 --> 02:24.130
So we populate this that we get and get these number ideas right.

02:24.430 --> 02:27.210
But with Foxley this is what we're going to get

02:31.670 --> 02:38.420
and it's going to get the name B.M. and all the you know attributes that belongs to this specific user

02:38.430 --> 02:41.210
because owner is referring to.

02:41.280 --> 02:45.320
If you go to product owner is referring to user.

02:45.330 --> 02:52.310
So when we populate we can see all these data like email name password picture seller address and so

02:52.310 --> 02:53.520
on.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.410
So you want to go back to sell it.

02:55.430 --> 02:56.270
Yes.

02:56.490 --> 02:59.390
And that's exactly Poppy in a nutshell.

02:59.400 --> 03:05.550
Same goes to category because we want to know what is the category that belongs to this product.

03:05.550 --> 03:12.060
So for example if you go to the correct product belongs to books get read and we want to show the name

03:12.060 --> 03:17.880
of the category because we dot populating the category field then you're just going to be this number.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.880
So let's go ahead and do it again

03:25.620 --> 03:28.540
and then we're going to remove this.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.520
So what is Zach.

03:30.570 --> 03:38.000
So if he has more than one function to execute on one mongoose operation then you need exec to help

03:38.000 --> 03:44.300
you because let's see if you have you want to do populate on this mongooses operation then you want

03:44.300 --> 03:49.240
to run exec then you're going to get the error and the result of the query.

03:49.640 --> 03:57.380
So now if there is a product or day or products that you want to respond to adjacent data with products

03:57.380 --> 04:00.250
object message and success true.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.570
So let's go ahead and test this route.

04:02.570 --> 04:11.080
So it's good to hear and open new up and want to look at post-military API.

04:11.290 --> 04:18.270
So our products and you want to get Let's just go here and change these to get.

04:18.890 --> 04:22.690
And you want to parse right.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.070
Right now we are receiving area.

04:26.270 --> 04:33.830
Curse me for God to see if this file will file go back to.

04:34.220 --> 04:35.090
Everything's good.

04:35.180 --> 04:35.870
So send

04:40.110 --> 04:40.680
me.

04:40.980 --> 04:47.140
So he shows all the items all the products that the seller actually posted.

04:47.140 --> 04:53.600
So we posted one item just now so technically this is what I'm saying.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.610
Owner and category.

04:56.620 --> 04:59.790
So imagine if I don't actually put populate.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.140
Right.

05:00.220 --> 05:06.220
So I want to leave this to save it go back to the postman.

05:06.610 --> 05:07.960
And I'm going to send this again

05:11.180 --> 05:14.370
you see it just going to show the owner.

05:14.620 --> 05:21.040
I mean it's just going to show the object id on both categories on both attributes owner and Gary.

05:21.340 --> 05:27.840
But if you put populate it was showed information within this object I.D. So let's go ahead and see

05:27.960 --> 05:38.660
if this and I'm going to send again and you can see it shows the owner you know information as well

05:38.660 --> 05:40.040
as category information.

05:41.560 --> 05:42.180
Awesome.

05:42.250 --> 05:47.140
In this video we learn how to populate an object id did it time in the next video.

05:47.470 --> 05:54.490
We will learn how to generate fake data to increase the amount of products that a seller could own or

05:54.490 --> 05:59.130
we just want to make our product has as many as products possible.

05:59.380 --> 06:01.520
So I'll see you guys in the next video.
