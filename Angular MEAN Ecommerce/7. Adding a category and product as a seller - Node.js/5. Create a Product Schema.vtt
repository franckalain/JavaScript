Hello X will come back.

00:02.380 --> 00:07.990
We need to create a product schema so that we can pre-Chase the product and even seller could sell or

00:07.990 --> 00:13.640
upload the product in this video we will create our schema which will be products schema.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.500
So we go in and create a new file.

00:15.500 --> 00:22.420
So it's a good visual studio and underneath models you file and you want to give a name product.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.710
Yes.

00:23.780 --> 00:25.980
So for groups

01:06.360 --> 01:07.450
copy this

01:52.090 --> 01:53.610
it is pretty straightforward.

01:53.870 --> 02:00.740
We create a product schema the attributes our category owner Image title description price and time

02:00.770 --> 02:05.500
creation category and only have different data type.

02:05.580 --> 02:11.580
This time it is object id every object that is created will have an idea for.

02:11.580 --> 02:17.700
So whenever you create a product you will always have this by default for example.

02:17.700 --> 02:24.320
So yes I mean this.

02:24.490 --> 02:30.280
So for example category whenever we create a new category so for example it's good to postman and this

02:30.280 --> 02:31.290
is the idea right.

02:31.290 --> 02:32.620
You can see this idea.

02:33.010 --> 02:44.220
You want to copy this and then we want to store it in the category attributes which this so that we

02:44.220 --> 02:49.960
know that this product belongs to this specific category which is cats.

02:50.190 --> 02:52.010
So you will see and actually run.

02:52.140 --> 02:58.060
Why do we need to store object id so that finally this really does for us.

02:58.400 --> 03:04.710
After all these things have done then we export the products Kema and that's that.

03:04.850 --> 03:10.760
In this video we created our schema which is Prolog schema in the next video we will create Amazon Web

03:10.760 --> 03:11.990
Services account.

03:11.990 --> 03:14.660
So I'll see you guys in the next video.
