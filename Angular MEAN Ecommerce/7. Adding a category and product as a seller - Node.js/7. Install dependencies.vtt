Hello guys will come back in this video we will install all the important dependencies and import them

00:05.850 --> 00:09.360
in a new raw file which will call SALIR.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.350
Yes.

00:10.380 --> 00:11.860
So just go ahead and do it.

00:11.970 --> 00:15.320
First of all we need to install a couple of dependencies first.

00:15.540 --> 00:23.450
So go to your terminal and you want to stop this server and 22:00 install it.

00:23.490 --> 00:24.130
Yes.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.050
OK.

00:25.410 --> 00:29.460
Monitor monitor us tree and dash dash

00:39.810 --> 00:41.120
so now it is at.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.430
It has finished install.

00:42.730 --> 00:50.020
So we go back to Visual Studio and we want to cut this and let's go two routes and create a new file

00:50.480 --> 00:54.640
and Graeme Celadon Yes they want a PC here right.

00:56.470 --> 00:58.750
Now we want to import all the events.

00:58.790 --> 01:02.670
So months or we're

01:09.740 --> 01:14.870
importing the product because we wind up with a properly run.

01:14.990 --> 01:20.460
So models product that we want to upload.

01:20.510 --> 01:27.550
I mean sorry we want to import all the important dependencies like icons has wire.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.440
Yes that's the key.

01:31.790 --> 01:38.560
And then the next thing is icons monitor Walter

01:47.030 --> 01:50.120
does the war

01:55.470 --> 02:15.330
on us treat us as free access evil will be sworn in this year.

02:16.310 --> 02:31.460
And when will the Secret Service be.

02:31.970 --> 02:40.110
Now we can actually do more to so we us as the case is a library for communicating with our services.

02:40.110 --> 02:49.140
In our case it is as tree and that the Nexus mulcher is a library to upload images and then multi-entry

02:49.550 --> 02:52.530
is a library to upload directly to our street.

02:52.740 --> 02:59.630
And finally in order for us to communicate with our story bucket we need to put the access key ID and

02:59.850 --> 03:02.470
as well as the secret key.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.900
Finally we want to export this file format

03:09.960 --> 03:11.890
and then you want to go to server.

03:11.950 --> 03:13.020
Yes.

03:13.210 --> 03:23.330
Again you want to or some other daddy yes.

03:23.820 --> 03:25.430
Copy this.

03:28.550 --> 03:30.540
And you want to change it.

03:30.810 --> 03:37.400
I shall enter this dog cool.

03:37.440 --> 03:43.350
It is a video we have set up configuration so that we could use the library to upload our product picture

03:43.890 --> 03:45.180
in the next video.

03:45.290 --> 03:47.490
We will create an upload function.

03:47.490 --> 03:49.750
So I'll see you guys in the next video.
