00:00.560 --> 00:02.400
Helga I will come back in this video.

00:02.450 --> 00:06.010
We will learn how to get all the categories that we just created.

00:06.380 --> 00:09.780
Let's fill in in the get method scores go to View studio.

00:10.250 --> 00:18.610
Let's go back to your main address and in here let's fill in on was response next.

00:18.920 --> 00:23.080
And I didn't really want to search for every single inch fine.

00:31.500 --> 00:32.470
And then you went over to

00:42.630 --> 00:42.920
see

00:49.110 --> 00:50.370
finally.

00:50.810 --> 00:51.120
So

00:57.410 --> 01:04.310
fine it's a function by mongoose to find all the documents in the database that have specific or similar

01:04.310 --> 01:05.210
attributes.

01:05.360 --> 01:09.950
In our case we just wanted a database to return all the category documents.

01:09.950 --> 01:13.620
Hence why we did not put anything in a bracket.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.340
We didn't do anything here.

01:15.620 --> 01:19.530
Then we responded to Kerry's object in Jason format.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.180
So let's go ahead and test this out.

01:22.110 --> 01:27.450
So is good to our postman and let's change this to cat instead.

01:29.190 --> 01:38.060
So successful and change to get Senate and it chose only one.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.640
We doubt any name.

01:39.750 --> 01:40.680
There's a reason why.

01:40.850 --> 01:45.330
If you go to posts with the body and it's supposed to be category

01:49.000 --> 01:54.680
not name because he would go to hear Post actually request a body category.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.040
So go here and send it again.

01:57.510 --> 01:59.100
And good to get.

01:59.100 --> 02:03.690
And if you get again now chose another one called cats.

02:03.700 --> 02:08.180
So if you want to believe this so you have to go back to LA

02:11.990 --> 02:12.740
again.

02:15.240 --> 02:16.300
And loggin

02:20.310 --> 02:30.460
I wasn't aware of the Kishin category's and you want to remove the first one.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.820
If you want to go back to Boseman go ahead and get it.

02:36.870 --> 02:41.090
No way I'll ever have one which is name name caps.

02:41.270 --> 02:44.180
So let's go do one more posts.

02:44.220 --> 02:47.860
Choose books because we didn't see if you care enough

02:54.930 --> 02:55.680
successful.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.980
Go ahead and get.

02:58.890 --> 03:01.560
So now we have cats and books category's.

03:01.770 --> 03:07.560
Congratulation guy in his video will learn how to get all the documents in the category schema in the

03:07.560 --> 03:08.680
next review.

03:08.910 --> 03:13.310
We will create a new schema which we will call product schema.

03:13.650 --> 03:15.590
Or see us in the next video.
