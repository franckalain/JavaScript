Hello guys will come back in the last section.

00:03.090 --> 00:10.020
Adam Peterson have helped guys true on how to build the front end but for the product API in this video

00:10.410 --> 00:14.820
we will create our full schema which is revealed schema.

00:15.090 --> 00:17.160
Let's go ahead and do that.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.510
So who are your server.

00:18.890 --> 00:23.020
Other models create a new file and give it a name review.

00:23.050 --> 00:24.440
G s.

00:24.680 --> 01:39.730
So now you want in or mongoose.

01:40.540 --> 01:47.380
So we have owner which will have the object id data type because we want to store the user id so that

01:47.380 --> 01:54.910
we could populate that Iran and we have title descriptions will be string rading will be a number type

01:55.270 --> 02:00.750
data type because we will store a number later like 1 2 3 4 5 for example.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.240
Lastly is the time created data type is data in this video.

02:07.330 --> 02:14.920
We created our fourth schema which is a review schema in the next video will create a review API so

02:14.920 --> 02:18.770
the user could post a review on every product.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.900
I'll see you guys in the next video.
