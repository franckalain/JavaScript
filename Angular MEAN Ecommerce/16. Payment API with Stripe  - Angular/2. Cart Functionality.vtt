00:00.300 --> 00:03.410
In know that's really all set up the payment system.

00:03.760 --> 00:10.500
A lot of it's required dependencies initially deal with some of the functionality start to open there

00:10.500 --> 00:14.340
are text and it'll open up their service

00:25.420 --> 00:26.100
here.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.520
We've created a wearable items.

00:28.650 --> 00:32.670
We used to store a number of items that are currently in a shopping cart

00:44.350 --> 00:45.070
here.

00:45.230 --> 00:51.180
We've created a get cut that should return the shopping cart if the shopping cart exists.

00:51.340 --> 00:54.390
Otherwise you would just return an empty array.

01:15.930 --> 01:22.680
Here you create the function which allows us to add a per hour of our choosing to the shopping cart

01:23.900 --> 01:27.460
if the program isn't already in a shopping cart you'll be added.

01:27.720 --> 01:31.090
And the items wearable will be increased by one.

01:31.140 --> 01:34.160
Otherwise there wouldn't be added to the shopping cart.

01:41.460 --> 01:48.470
Here is clearly the clear cut function which resets the number of items to zero and clears the shipping

01:48.490 --> 01:48.870
costs

02:13.760 --> 02:14.620
here.

02:14.760 --> 02:20.500
We've created a remove from function which allows us to remove a product from a shopping cart.

02:21.020 --> 02:29.180
If a product is found the present will be removed and the items very low will be decreased by one.

02:29.180 --> 02:31.250
Now let's open up component

02:42.640 --> 02:48.870
here instead the constructor we have set items because of the length of the shopping cart.

02:48.900 --> 02:55.690
In setting there are service in setting the lock up meant that we also reset the items were built in

02:55.730 --> 02:58.270
there service to 0.

02:58.270 --> 03:01.390
Now that's open a component issue.

03:13.090 --> 03:20.220
In here we've added the TX as well as the batch that were displayed a number of items in the shopping

03:20.220 --> 03:20.920
cart.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.790
Now let's open up the component

03:40.240 --> 03:45.350
here is created to function it will display a success message.

03:45.370 --> 03:50.290
If you successfully edit the current and an error message if the product has already been added to the

03:50.290 --> 03:50.900
card.

03:51.220 --> 03:53.530
Now let's open up that component.

03:53.540 --> 03:54.180
Actually a mail

04:07.070 --> 04:12.420
here we've added a button at the current through the shopping cart.

04:12.590 --> 04:15.550
In this redo we've set up the functionality.

04:15.980 --> 04:20.020
Now let's take a look at our app.

04:21.170 --> 04:25.630
Let's go to the product page and click at the car.

04:25.970 --> 04:29.130
And here you can see the numbers increase by 1.

04:29.150 --> 04:31.440
We try to look at the cut again.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.530
Action will fail in the next redo.

04:34.580 --> 04:36.220
It will set up the car component.
