WEBVTT

00:00.370 --> 00:05.240
Know that a search is done it's time to implement it etc. and get an app.

00:05.520 --> 00:08.280
And we do it we are setting up our search component.

00:08.560 --> 00:11.170
Let's start by opening up my shop window.

00:11.350 --> 00:21.040
Our angular Amazonian directory and then type in and regenerate component search and enter.

00:21.040 --> 00:29.980
Once this is done and we search minimize the window we'll put a text editor and open up at routeing

00:29.990 --> 00:30.330
would you

00:42.100 --> 00:46.780
here important our social component and be it as a route.

00:47.170 --> 00:49.240
Now let's open up our search Complan

01:13.220 --> 01:15.510
here imported through that route.

01:15.790 --> 01:20.810
It a service press a PR service and instead she did them inside a constructor.

01:20.940 --> 01:22.730
We've also decrypt numerable query.

01:22.820 --> 01:29.460
You use to start a search query page should be used to start a search push number and content.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.700
Use to start of such pitch content's

01:41.790 --> 01:48.860
the end you only need to be run every time the pitches that you decided to get the search query from

01:48.940 --> 01:54.370
angular with that route set the number to 1 and then get products

02:10.170 --> 02:13.950
for each component to be using the pagination setting from the server.

02:14.400 --> 02:20.850
The low will getter gets the lower limit from the server and upper begetter gets the upper limit from

02:20.850 --> 02:21.330
the server

02:48.340 --> 02:49.140
here.

02:49.200 --> 02:54.010
We've created a get products that are clear are such contents when it is executed.

02:54.580 --> 03:01.920
Then the results will be retrieved using the link to Keary and the pitch provided when the response

03:01.920 --> 03:05.560
is received from the server to be assigned to the variable data.

03:06.040 --> 03:09.380
Then to check if success on data is true.

03:09.520 --> 03:15.950
If success is true that our content assigned to this Stockland than otherwise an error message should

03:15.950 --> 03:16.770
be displayed.

03:17.420 --> 03:21.860
If an error occurs on the site the error message should be displayed as well.

03:21.860 --> 03:24.900
Now let's open up each component issue.

03:41.300 --> 03:48.560
Here you've created a section that contains the container which contains the message and the loading

03:48.560 --> 03:49.010
spinner

04:17.870 --> 04:23.350
or here if you create that heading text only be shown when its contents have been loaded.

04:23.470 --> 04:27.340
And there are no results what a search terms specified below it.

04:27.460 --> 04:32.620
We have a day if we only be shown when there's such contents have been loaded and there are results

04:32.620 --> 04:33.790
for such time especially for

05:26.760 --> 05:30.130
here we've created this.

05:30.210 --> 05:33.310
It will show the details of the products to match our kiri

05:35.910 --> 05:42.190
here if pagination links allows to use it or never get truly front pages of the search results.

05:46.370 --> 05:52.070
After such action they've created an entry template should we use for rating bar.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.530
Now that's opened up compelling

06:09.820 --> 06:14.840
site in a search function to call collops the mobile menu and never get to the search page.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.130
We have a search term.

06:16.130 --> 06:21.990
When a startup is not empty miss we have set up a search component.

06:22.020 --> 06:23.820
Now let's take a look at our app

06:26.920 --> 06:29.490
this search for the word team.

06:30.460 --> 06:35.800
And here we can see the results the return for letter T in the next section.

06:35.860 --> 06:38.530
Setting up the payment API on the server side.
