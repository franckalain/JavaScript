00:00.480 --> 00:01.920
They'll come back.

00:02.030 --> 00:09.100
Last we deal with Krita the category's component in this media will create a category function as soon

00:09.110 --> 00:11.070
as a user interface for it.

00:11.070 --> 00:21.070
Now let's open up our text editor go to categories component add into new workbooks new category

00:24.040 --> 01:00.470
and stable.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.990
Here is create that category function when a function is run.

01:05.990 --> 01:08.610
It can read but then will be disabled.

01:08.640 --> 01:15.480
The new category would then be posted to the server and wait for a response the response will be assigned

01:15.480 --> 01:16.690
to wearable data.

01:17.420 --> 01:21.260
And then check if success on data is true.

01:21.260 --> 01:24.780
If success is true the success will be displayed.

01:25.220 --> 01:27.870
Otherwise the error message will be displayed.

01:28.490 --> 01:32.660
If an error occurs error message should be displayed here.

01:32.900 --> 01:36.680
Once this is all done but over and over again.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.790
Now let's open up category's component DML

02:19.590 --> 02:20.260
here.

02:20.520 --> 02:25.050
If created our new category far below our list of categories.

02:25.080 --> 02:30.980
Now let's go back to our current Groos component at all here.

02:31.270 --> 02:38.580
It's safe in this we created the new category functionality along with the user interface.

02:38.580 --> 02:45.860
Now take look what if beaute lets make sure that no one is running and open up our app

02:52.130 --> 03:00.660
to the category's page and we can see lots of categories here and a new new category from all here.

03:00.660 --> 03:04.240
Let's add a new category.

03:07.740 --> 03:17.510
And here to say successful and refresh the page we can see that it is now here in the next video will

03:17.780 --> 03:19.390
