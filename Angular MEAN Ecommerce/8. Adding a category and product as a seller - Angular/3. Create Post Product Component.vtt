HI GUYS THE we do you've set up a new category functionality in this video would be creating the poster

00:07.410 --> 00:08.240
component.

00:08.460 --> 00:14.430
Let's start by opening up about how shall we know in center and get an Amazon directory and then type

00:14.430 --> 00:17.210
in and regenerate.

00:17.970 --> 00:26.920
When most of this is done and the search I mean the most.

00:27.480 --> 00:33.460
Now let's open up my text editor and go to app routing will you.

00:50.360 --> 00:55.050
Here is important to post a component and declare it as a route.

00:55.340 --> 00:57.640
Now let's open up was put a component

01:30.100 --> 01:38.250
here in part of the router rest a service and there's service at East and she did them inside the constructor.

01:38.260 --> 01:45.060
There were about fraud that is used to store information on the product the user wishes to post the

01:45.060 --> 01:49.380
verbal characteris is used to contain a list of categories inside.

01:49.930 --> 02:15.820
And they were able to say most is used to enable and disable the post button.

02:16.120 --> 02:21.500
The energy on it could run every time the pictures visited inside it.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.300
Look at the list of categories available

02:56.730 --> 02:57.510
here.

02:57.610 --> 03:03.490
We have already decided that this is pretty much similar to the way that your methods use that are locked

03:03.490 --> 03:11.710
in a restriction component.

03:11.960 --> 03:18.410
The phone change method is used to retrieve the image from the image input in the post-war form.

04:15.470 --> 04:23.630
And the post function is run the post the button will be disabled then as well that the data is at the

04:23.640 --> 04:27.120
For if when it actually is successful.

04:27.150 --> 04:35.370
I knew from that that would be create everything on a firm added to it then from that time we posted

04:35.370 --> 04:43.110
the link here and the responses received from the server would be assigned to label data.

04:43.110 --> 04:46.250
Then we would check if success on data is true.

04:46.260 --> 04:50.160
If success is true you display a success message.

04:50.160 --> 04:56.090
Otherwise you display an error message if an error occurs the display error message as well.

04:56.610 --> 04:59.870
Once this is finish you enable the pattern again.

04:59.880 --> 05:03.210
Now let's open up postproduction DML

05:23.620 --> 05:30.870
here this create a post-production section which contains a container which contains the heading text

05:31.230 --> 05:36.870
is a product for sale at message and the Lotus spinner

07:10.310 --> 07:10.820
here.

07:10.980 --> 07:13.270
We've created a post-production form.

07:13.380 --> 07:17.720
The poster will be shown the list of categories has been loaded.

07:18.500 --> 07:25.530
Here we have a drop down which displays the list of categories and the folks there are here.

07:25.780 --> 07:30.720
It allows us to choose an image for our product in this video.

07:30.910 --> 07:32.870
They've set up a poster for that component.

07:33.390 --> 07:36.810
Let's make sure that not one is running and open up our app

07:40.340 --> 07:42.200
so no one is running over here.

07:42.340 --> 07:50.120
This minimizes this mess go to our profile page also put up for sale

08:17.120 --> 08:23.510
and here you can see that our board has been successfully posted unless we deal with a set of the my

08:23.510 --> 08:24.800
products component.
