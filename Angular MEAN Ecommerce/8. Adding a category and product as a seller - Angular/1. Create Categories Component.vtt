00:00.770 --> 00:06.540
Now that the the categories post-road up in my plus HPF been done it's time to implement them.

00:06.920 --> 00:11.800
And you are at this media recreating the category's component.

00:12.090 --> 00:24.140
Let's start by opening up how shall we know is our angular Amazon or directory type and regenerate categories.

00:24.810 --> 00:35.520
Once this is done and we serve it now open up we studio and open up at routeing would you

00:50.750 --> 00:55.390
here we've imported the kangaroo's component and declared as a route.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.350
Now let's open up categories component

01:13.810 --> 01:20.330
inside the category's component with T-Clip duress API Cirus and there are Cerise and instead she them

01:20.330 --> 01:22.280
inside a constructor.

01:22.340 --> 01:24.790
Also created the categories workbook.

01:24.870 --> 01:50.150
Should be use to start a list of categories which tree from the server.

01:50.170 --> 01:52.930
So this is our energy on that matter.

01:53.200 --> 02:01.120
We should be run every time to pitch it inside it get the list of categories from the server using the

02:01.120 --> 02:09.760
link here the server response is then assigned to the workbook data then check if success on that is

02:09.770 --> 02:10.830
true.

02:10.850 --> 02:15.440
If success is true then the categories would be assigned to categories.

02:16.270 --> 02:22.590
Else entered message from the server would be displayed if an error occurs the error message should

02:22.590 --> 02:24.480
be displayed as well.

02:24.480 --> 02:25.190
Moving on.

02:25.370 --> 02:27.920
Let's open up Kangaroo's component here.

02:38.340 --> 02:46.590
Here you've created a section that contains a container which contains the message and hitting Tex categories

02:59.400 --> 03:00.000
here.

03:00.060 --> 03:01.850
You've created a loading spinner.

03:01.950 --> 03:04.570
It only shows to categorize hasn't been loaded.

03:26.400 --> 03:32.100
The loader loading Spinner is a diff only be shown when the list of categories has been loaded instead

03:32.260 --> 03:40.230
of a diff you create a list of links that showed the name and the links for each category.

03:40.980 --> 03:44.120
In this we deal with query that the categories component.

03:44.310 --> 03:46.650
Now let's take a look at what if beaute.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.120
Let's make sure that no one is running and that open our app

03:55.890 --> 03:59.440
Let's go to the categories page and there we have it.

03:59.670 --> 04:07.260
You can see the list of categories that are at it and you'll create a category function along with the

04:07.480 --> 04:08.740
category user interface.
