00:01.110 --> 00:05.330
So now we want to do is we want to open up our power shelf.

00:05.670 --> 00:14.480
So I'm going to open up my power shall see and I don't know the server and then install the official

00:14.480 --> 00:15.340
script and then see

00:20.120 --> 00:20.910
one save.

00:20.910 --> 00:21.950
You want to open up.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.290
They just do.

00:25.390 --> 00:29.000
And I'm going to open up a server and I'm going to get two routes.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.320
I mean yes.

00:30.740 --> 00:38.390
And right below saying let's make the same topic cons and then.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.140

00:39.380 --> 00:42.220
Because too little wire.

00:42.350 --> 00:43.080
Right.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.200
And then we're going to pass the secret key.

00:46.370 --> 00:54.740
So let's go back to Chrome and I'm going to copy this entire thing copy it and I'm going to paste it

00:54.740 --> 00:55.110
here

00:59.100 --> 01:08.250

01:08.390 --> 01:09.240
