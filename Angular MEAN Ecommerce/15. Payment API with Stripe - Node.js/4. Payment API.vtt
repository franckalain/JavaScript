Payment is super essential when it comes to e-commerce Web site because without payment it will be almost

00:06.630 --> 00:10.130
impossible to purchase a product in this video.

00:10.170 --> 00:14.190
We will learn how to create an API using stripe.

00:14.220 --> 00:15.740
So go ahead and do that.

00:15.900 --> 00:16.780
So good I mean.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.140
Yes.

00:19.230 --> 00:30.630
And what you want to do is you want to import nodders you are called Polder.

00:31.710 --> 00:33.120
Right.

00:33.340 --> 00:40.600
And then you want to go on year and you want to create you know the payment API.

00:40.660 --> 00:42.220
So the logic is quite simple.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.020
We want to charge the customers.

00:44.110 --> 00:50.050
Then after we charge then only we want to create the Order object or order schema.

00:50.410 --> 02:08.690
So let's go ahead and router those.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.950
Did you guys enjoy the music.

02:11.140 --> 02:18.940
If you do then please leave me a five star view and I'll definitely put more awesome music in the future.

02:18.940 --> 02:19.820
Now I'm just joking.

02:19.830 --> 02:20.790
It's up to you.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.170
How many stars do you want to give me.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.640
So let me explain.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.070
From top to bottom.

02:26.230 --> 02:32.980
First is we are doing post requests to the server and that we are sending the GOP talking so that we

02:32.980 --> 02:39.330
can check what a token is value not and only we can use the request encoded user dot on his right knee

02:40.790 --> 02:48.890
and then we take the striped token from the front end and then we the charge you know we'd always be

02:49.790 --> 02:51.290
multiply by 100.

02:51.290 --> 02:56.660
The reason why because Strype will automatically automatically convert.

02:56.660 --> 03:05.170
For example if it is two hundred and fifty dollars it will automatically convert to it goes to 2.5.

03:05.450 --> 03:12.100
So we always have 10 times 100 to get this amount which is 250.

03:12.560 --> 03:20.660
So that's the reason why we times hundred of the total price of the cart for example and then next thing

03:20.660 --> 03:29.220
is we create the right customer once that we pass in the Strub token that I need for this type token

03:29.640 --> 03:34.470
we got from the front end and and we just want to get the ID so that we can verify right.

03:34.530 --> 03:43.450
This customer actually pre-Chase this and only this customer has the specific And then we charge the

03:43.480 --> 03:45.390
customer.

03:45.440 --> 03:50.980
So we want to check if the token is valid or not if it's valid then we want to charge the customer.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.550
We give giving the amount.

03:52.790 --> 04:00.600
And in us the and then after that we send the customer into an idea because we want to make you unique.

04:00.650 --> 04:06.960
So once we charge the customer then we want to create the order actually.

04:06.980 --> 04:15.430
So we want to bring the Order object so that we can see any transactions that we use it has me so.

04:15.560 --> 04:23.090
And then after we have technically created the order we want to push all the products all the products

04:23.270 --> 04:26.370
from the cart to the order schema.

04:26.390 --> 04:33.560
For example let's see if we have five products that we want to send one by one to brush maybe a computer

04:34.030 --> 04:36.680
and the quantity will be one or two or three.

04:37.010 --> 04:40.660
So we want to push the products every.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.230
So that's about it.

04:42.550 --> 04:49.200
And then finally we want to save the order and then we want a response you know with a success and message

04:49.220 --> 04:53.200
successfully meet a and it's as simple as that.

04:53.530 --> 04:54.940
So it is Bruce.

04:55.210 --> 05:00.640
First we take the token for a front end and then we take the top prize in times 100.

05:00.790 --> 05:06.280
So we get an actual amount and save it on stripe and then we create the customer because we wanted to

05:06.280 --> 05:07.620
make it unique.

05:07.780 --> 05:13.580
But you get a sense the idea of the token and then we charge the customer.

05:13.880 --> 05:22.610
And then finally we actually created the Order object so we can see all the products or told price and

05:22.610 --> 05:23.600
so on and so forth.

05:26.360 --> 05:31.640
Unfortunately we can't all the test is raw when the front end is presented.

05:32.000 --> 05:41.270
So in the next video or section at imprisonable actually Bill the cart component so that you can actually

05:41.270 --> 05:44.370
use this API and test it out.

05:44.370 --> 05:47.240
I'll see you guys in the next section by.
