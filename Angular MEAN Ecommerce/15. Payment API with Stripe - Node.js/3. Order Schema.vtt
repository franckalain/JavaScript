Hello guys will come back in this video we will create an order schema where everybody that you meet

00:06.830 --> 00:09.060
will be safe in this Kema.

00:09.380 --> 00:10.700
So let's go out and do that.

00:10.940 --> 00:16.340
So go to models Rugeley on it you find and get a name or the dog.

00:16.460 --> 00:17.760
Yes.

00:17.820 --> 00:18.290
So go.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.710
And wire or import all the sporting events

00:30.440 --> 00:32.250
or to make our lives easier.

00:32.330 --> 00:41.910
You can actually go to Calgary competition I think to year and this year and just changed his or her

00:46.600 --> 00:53.050
and we just need to change a couple of attributes your first order so we don't forget later on

00:56.190 --> 01:01.070
and we need owner first.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.680
For me is on

01:14.650 --> 01:15.050
a

01:18.690 --> 01:22.620
price right.

01:23.700 --> 01:28.050
All right.

01:28.550 --> 01:31.470
And really this is

01:34.950 --> 01:35.250
the

01:40.140 --> 01:40.870
type of

01:43.930 --> 01:44.640
object

01:48.970 --> 01:49.540
oriented

02:05.760 --> 02:12.980
products will have an area where we will store all the products that we pre-Chase over here and account

02:13.050 --> 02:14.240
quantities well.

02:14.490 --> 02:16.940
So each product will have the quantity.

02:17.160 --> 02:21.330
Reason why is because sometimes you want to produce more than one quantity.

02:21.330 --> 02:23.540
For example let's say toothbrush.

02:23.790 --> 02:29.060
Maybe you want to buy it for your grandma or your uncle and you guys to buy more than one.

02:29.460 --> 02:31.570
So that's the reason I want to set one.

02:31.910 --> 02:38.120
So brought out tooth brush County maybe tree for your grandma yourself and your uncle.

02:38.180 --> 02:39.080
So that's about it.

02:39.260 --> 02:43.040
In this video we learn how to greet an older schema.

02:43.040 --> 02:48.550
The schema will only be created only if you made any order.

02:48.600 --> 02:55.260
So in the next video we will learn how to create the payment API using Strype and eventually safety

02:55.260 --> 02:57.400
data into order schema.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.240
I'll see you guys in the next video.
