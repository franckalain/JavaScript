Hello guys will come back in this section will create a sprite account and we will learn how to get

00:06.600 --> 00:10.820
to APHC so that we can store in a variable Iran.

00:10.830 --> 00:17.390
The reason why we need to use tripe is because every e-commerce website needs a payment.

00:17.900 --> 00:24.810
So strike is the easiest way for developers to implement on their websites.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.180
So let's go ahead and create our account.

00:27.380 --> 00:31.830
So for me I so you're going to go to dashboard Once you create it.

00:35.020 --> 00:37.650
So you can see the amazing user interface.

00:37.660 --> 00:39.810
You can check pieman.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.460
We have no test data yet.

00:42.640 --> 00:48.980
And then you can check disputes if you have any problems if any customers actually you know want a refund

00:48.980 --> 00:54.570
or something and then you can check all of these amazing features.

00:54.610 --> 00:57.370
So we're definitely going to go to EPRI.

00:57.430 --> 01:02.900
So what you need to do is you want to get the secret key and then you want to paste it on your no just

01:02.980 --> 01:04.050
occasionally wrong.

01:04.380 --> 01:14.910
So a quick try again and I'm going to enter my password.

01:15.050 --> 01:21.530
So that's about it in the next few do we get to install this dependency so that we can use it.

01:21.530 --> 01:22.940
I'll see you in the next few.
