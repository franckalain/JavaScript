00:00.360 --> 00:07.520
In the last video you've set up the production pool and we deal with setting up the product carts in

00:07.740 --> 00:08.750
our home page.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.630
Let's start by opening up the home component inside our text editor

00:29.410 --> 00:34.180
here is important data service and a peer service.

00:34.400 --> 00:41.410
And she did them as a constructor also declared the wearable products which we be use to start a list

00:41.410 --> 01:03.850
of products on the server.

01:04.030 --> 01:07.470
The energy that we run every time the page is visited.

01:07.790 --> 01:14.130
Inside it will get a list of products from the link here when the response is receive from the server.

01:14.330 --> 01:18.530
We assign the data then we check.

01:18.600 --> 01:19.980
This is true.

01:19.990 --> 01:24.830
If success is true there the products assigned to products.

01:25.020 --> 01:31.180
Otherwise every message should be displayed if an error occurs on a client's site the error message

01:31.180 --> 01:32.290
will disappear as well.

01:32.410 --> 01:35.170
Now let's open up some company mail.

02:21.700 --> 02:29.280
Here we've created a container it contains the message Loney's spinner and a list of product carts.

02:29.620 --> 02:33.660
In this video have set up the product carts instead of home component.

02:34.060 --> 02:41.120
Now let's take a look at what we've built let's make sure that no one is running that open up our app

02:43.160 --> 02:47.820
here we can see the cars are now working inside our home.

02:47.860 --> 02:53.340
Then in the next section we're setting up a real API on the server side.
