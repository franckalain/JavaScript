Now that the categories and products are done it's time to run them in sort of angular misery.

00:08.320 --> 00:11.080
We're talking about a concept of pagination.

00:11.500 --> 00:18.150
Well what is pagination pagination is used to separate content into multiple pages.

00:18.400 --> 00:26.370
For example list of 70 items we have seven pages when using a pagination setting of 10 hours per page.

00:26.530 --> 00:29.140
Well what are the benefits of pagination then.

00:30.540 --> 00:35.380
Pagination allows for faster loading times instead of loading all items at once.

00:35.460 --> 00:39.340
The app only has to look and comes at the time.

00:39.570 --> 00:45.390
Pagination also allows for cleaner user interface since there is less content on the screen.

00:45.390 --> 00:48.460
The app is less likely to cause confusion to the user.

00:48.540 --> 00:53.380
To go look at it and example in the first page.

00:53.560 --> 01:02.740
The pic shows results 1 to 16 in the second page the pic shows results 17 to 32 in the third page.

01:02.810 --> 01:04.000
The pic shows results.

01:04.010 --> 01:05.880
Third tree to 27.

01:06.110 --> 01:13.320
Let me explain to pagination a setting is set to 16 hours per page when the app is in the first and

01:13.320 --> 01:15.240
second page of the results.

01:15.480 --> 01:23.840
Each page is based 16 results but when the app is in the turret page the app only displays 5 items.

01:23.880 --> 01:30.420
This is because the app only displays three tree from 3:07 instead of the tree to 48.

01:30.630 --> 01:35.040
This is mainly because the result is 30 40 do not exist.

01:35.040 --> 01:40.440
Let's take a look at how the calculations are performed for the lower limit.

01:40.470 --> 01:46.430
It's the Imus per page multiplied by current pitch minus one edit by one.

01:46.710 --> 01:54.180
So it's ten times four plus one which is what one for the upper limit.

01:54.190 --> 01:59.820
It's the minimum of the items per page multiply by current page and the total items.

02:00.000 --> 02:09.680
So the minimum of ten times five and 70 is 50 and a minimum of ten times five and forty five is forty

02:09.680 --> 02:10.740
five.

02:10.740 --> 02:14.520
In this video you talked about a concept of imagination.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.400
Next we deal with setting up a category component.
