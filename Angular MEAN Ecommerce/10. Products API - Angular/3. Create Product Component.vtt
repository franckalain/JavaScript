00:00.510 --> 00:08.520
Hey guys let's really set up a category component in this we deal with setting up a component.

00:08.580 --> 00:20.990
Let's start at a partial window instead of angular Amazonian tree and then type in and G the rate up.

00:22.350 --> 00:27.040
Once this is done and you serve minimize the command prompt.

00:27.390 --> 00:32.270
Once this is done we'll put up a text editor at routing Mungiu

00:43.820 --> 00:48.100
here is imported the product component and declare it as a route.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.540
Now let's open up that component

01:17.010 --> 01:17.890
here.

01:18.040 --> 01:22.740
Important at the router and the router and get around the package.

01:23.100 --> 01:28.790
There are service reps a service and then she did them inside of constructor.

01:29.250 --> 01:34.020
We've also created the white roll program which should be used to store information

02:02.760 --> 02:13.030
and that will be run every time the pictures inside it we will get the product ID from the angular actuator

02:13.070 --> 02:14.050
route.

02:14.460 --> 02:22.110
Then you get the information using the program Id provide a response when the server is then assigned

02:22.110 --> 02:27.780
to the variable data and then check if success on data is true.

02:27.780 --> 02:33.440
If success is true they will be assigned to put up.

02:33.520 --> 02:40.360
Otherwise the user we were back to the home page if an error occurs error message should be displayed.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.540
Now let's open up your computer here now.

02:58.780 --> 03:06.490
Here we've created a paradox section which contains a container to contest the message and then loading

03:06.490 --> 03:06.880
spinner

03:55.050 --> 04:02.890
or here is created that if you will only be shown when the information has been loaded it contains information

04:02.940 --> 04:13.510
such just the image the title the older category description and price.

04:13.510 --> 04:16.680
In this we do have set up the component.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.800
Now let's take a look at what if beaute

04:23.780 --> 04:28.970
let's make sure that no one is running and then open up our app.

04:28.970 --> 04:38.810
Now let's click on categories go to the cat's category and open up intelligent Reber mouse inside it.

04:38.820 --> 04:43.110
We have our image Tado the owner.

04:43.110 --> 04:48.310
The category description and the price.

04:48.650 --> 04:53.370
The next we deal with sitting on the carts in our home page.
