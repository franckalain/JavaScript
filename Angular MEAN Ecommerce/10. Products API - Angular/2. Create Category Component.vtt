You guys in the last video explain how pagination works in this video we're going to create a category

00:07.590 --> 00:11.000
component and implement pagination inside it.

00:11.010 --> 00:18.900
Let's start by it or how shall we know in our angular Amazonas directory and then type in and regenerate

00:19.760 --> 00:25.030
component category then we're anti-circ

00:40.950 --> 00:41.490
here.

00:41.660 --> 00:49.620
If you imported the category component and declare it as a rock and set the path ID will become the

00:49.620 --> 00:56.250
route parameters to what parameters can be retrieved using the angular actuator package.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.870
Let's take a look at an example.

01:00.070 --> 01:06.890
Run of categories slenderly 6 will result in the parameter ID 36.

01:06.890 --> 01:09.230
Now let's open up category component

01:38.070 --> 01:46.320
inside the category component of important to the router from router press a service it a Cirus and

01:46.330 --> 01:49.300
instant she didn't install a constructor.

01:49.310 --> 01:56.980
We've also created the category ID where both you use the starter category ID from the router.

01:57.400 --> 02:04.620
Category where both should be used to start category information and the pitch wearable which you'll

02:04.630 --> 02:07.890
be use to start a page that the user is currently on

02:18.030 --> 02:24.800
and only Niedermair will be run every time the page is visited inside it to check if the parameters

02:24.800 --> 02:32.190
have change if there are permanent change the category IAB will be updated and get products recalled

02:44.920 --> 02:50.590
for a category component to be using a pagination setting of 10 address per page.

02:50.590 --> 02:58.760
The local Geter gets the lower limits of the results and forgetter gets our upper limits of the results.

03:31.160 --> 03:35.780
We're here you have to get method inside it.

03:35.780 --> 03:43.060
We've declared the option of parameter event event passing the function as an argument.

03:43.190 --> 03:47.260
The category information will be clear and set the link.

03:47.270 --> 03:54.020
We have the category ID rule as well as the pitch where table says pagers on the server site begin with

03:54.020 --> 03:56.750
zero and the pages are at.

03:57.040 --> 04:02.220
If one Kapish number requested from the server should be the current pished number on.

04:02.220 --> 04:10.190
At minus 1 for example when we see the pitch one is on our app the pitch is there in the API should

04:10.190 --> 04:11.540
be zero.

04:11.540 --> 04:14.990
Now let's open up category component here.

04:33.850 --> 04:42.390
Here you've created a category section which contains a container that contains the message and the

04:42.400 --> 04:43.170
loading spinner

04:55.480 --> 04:56.940
will hear.

04:57.090 --> 05:01.110
Quit hating texting displayed no paradox in that category.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.740
The category has been loaded and there are no products.

05:03.740 --> 05:04.640
Is that a category.

06:25.300 --> 06:31.160
Here we've created a different it will only show when the category information is loaded and there's

06:31.160 --> 06:34.570
producta instead of category inside it.

06:34.800 --> 06:42.820
We have the category name limit upper limit and a total paradox and set a category.

06:43.580 --> 06:47.210
We also have the details of the products in that category.

06:47.210 --> 06:49.450
We also have angular bootstrap pagination.

06:49.450 --> 06:55.460
Over here the collection size is set to category for the products.

06:55.490 --> 07:00.190
The pitch size is set to 10 Khurram pitches mounted to pitch.

07:00.710 --> 07:05.630
When the pitch change is Angle angular bootstrap you get the paradox again.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.460
This video of the category component.

07:09.470 --> 07:16.190
Now let's take a look at what is beaute let's make sure that no one is running in it.

07:16.190 --> 07:27.230
Open up our app Let's go to the categories page let's go to cats here and see the products that are

07:27.230 --> 07:33.360
inside cats in the nets we do we will set our product component.
